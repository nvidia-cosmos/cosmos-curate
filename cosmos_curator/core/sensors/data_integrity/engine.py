"""Engine for the data-integrity metrics: run them all and judge them.

This is the single source of truth for *running every data-integrity metric against
its subject and evaluating the results*. What it adds on top of the metric kernel
(:mod:`.metrics` / :mod:`.evaluation`) is the running: :func:`run_metrics` streams one
open sensor's timeline into every per-stream metric and resolves the effective
expected rate (:func:`resolve_expected_hz`), while :func:`run_session_metrics` folds a
session's sensor bounds into every session-grain metric.

Everything here is pure compute over an already-open sensor. There is no I/O, no
URI handling and no argparse: opening a source is the caller's job, which is what
keeps this module usable by the sensor library itself. The value-level validators
(:func:`validate_expected_hz` and friends) are the library-boundary counterpart of
a CLI's argparse ``type=`` layer, so direct callers of these APIs get the same
fail-fast contract an operator would.

The vocabulary the results are expressed in lives in :mod:`.results`, and which
threshold applies to which measurement in :mod:`.instruments`. Rendering and
aggregation live with the callers.

    An explicit ``user_hz`` is the authoritative baseline: it states independently
    what the capture was supposed to be, which is the only way to judge whether it
    was right.

    The header value is best-effort and weaker than it looks. It comes from
    libav's ``AVStream.avg_frame_rate``, which is not guaranteed to preserve an
    encoder-declared cadence -- for MP4 it is commonly derived from the
    container's own sample-duration table, the same timing data the checked
    timestamps come from. Judged against such a value, gap and jitter still bite,
    because they measure variation *between* samples: an irregular cadence shows
    up whatever the baseline. The rate check does not, and cannot be relied on to
    catch a uniformly wrong capture rate, since a stream that ran entirely at the
    wrong speed tends to declare a header rate that matches it. Pass
