"""Stable identities for the streams and sessions a data-integrity run records.

A *stream* is not always a file: one MCAP holds many topics, each its own
timeline. So a stream is addressed by a file plus a **selector**
(``selector_type`` / ``selector_value``), and :func:`stream_id` hashes that triple
into the key every store dataset de-duplicates on.

The id is derived from the *absolute* source rather than from a session root plus
a relative key. The two carry the same information -- a root plus a relative key
reconstructs the source -- but the absolute form is invariant to **how the stream
was discovered**: checking one video directly and then checking the session that
contains it produces one identity instead of two rows for the same bytes.

Normalisation is deliberately narrow, and touches no filesystem: lowercase the URI
scheme, drop trailing slashes, and make local paths absolute. Nothing inside a cloud
object key is rewritten, because a key is an opaque string rather than a path.
Paths and S3 keys are case-sensitive, so case is never folded below the scheme, and
symlinks are left alone -- resolving them would make an id depend on the mount layout
of whichever machine happened to run the check.
