"""One registry entry per data-integrity metric: policy, wording, and row shape.

The kernel (:mod:`.metrics` / :mod:`.evaluation`) deliberately knows nothing about
which threshold applies to which measurement, or how a verdict is worded. That
knowledge used to be spelled out once per metric in the CLI and would have had to
be spelled out again by the store and again by re-evaluation. Here it is declared
once, so a new metric is a new :class:`InstrumentSpec` rather than a new branch in
three places -- and so a re-evaluated verdict is produced by exactly the same code
that produced the original: :func:`evaluate_metric`, the tool's one path from a
measurement to a verdict.

Two registries, because a metric's *subject* is part of its shape:
:data:`INSTRUMENTS` judges one stream, :data:`SESSION_INSTRUMENTS` judges a whole
session. The spec type is the same for both; what differs is who iterates it and what
they feed it.

:class:`Thresholds` lives here rather than with the CLI because a threshold is only
meaningful next to the accessor that reads it.

No ``pyarrow`` import: field *shapes* are declared as :class:`FieldSpec` and
translated to Arrow types by :mod:`.store_schema`, so importing the registry (which
the CLIs always do) never pulls in the storage stack (which they only do with
``--store-path``).
