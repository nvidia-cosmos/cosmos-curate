"""A sensor's observation timeline: a 1-D ``int64`` nanosecond ``.npy``.

When a sensor observed each of its samples is what every later alignment step
keys off, whatever the sensor is -- camera frames, IMU samples, GPS fixes, lidar
sweeps all reduce to one ascending sequence of instants. So the timeline is
stored in the one form that needs no interpretation: nanoseconds on the
recording device's clock, one entry per observation, strictly ascending, in a
plain ``.npy``.

Integer nanoseconds because a ``float64`` carries only 53 bits of mantissa. At
epoch-nanosecond magnitudes consecutive ``float64`` values are 256 ns apart, so
two instants closer together than that land on the same float, and the strictly
ascending rule this format rests on stops holding. ``.npy`` because it is self-describing enough that a reader can
reject a wrongly-typed file rather than reinterpret its bytes.

This module owns only that generic form, and deliberately knows nothing about
which sensor produced it. Deriving one from a recorder's own sidecar format is
the device adapter's job, not the library's.

    Takes an already-open stream rather than a path or a URI: callers own their

    ``smart_open.open`` returns a seekable stream for a local path, ``file://``
    and ``s3://`` alike, so one call covers every backend and no caller needs to
    branch on scheme.

    Stream only, with no ``Path`` arm. The sensor entry points still take a
    ``DataSource`` that admits ``Path``, but that arm is being removed from them;
    this is the shape they are moving to, not a narrowing to be reconciled.

    magic prefix and seeking back over it.

            is not this artifact, and a non-ascending array cannot be a timeline.
        OSError: If the stream itself fails while being read. Distinct from
