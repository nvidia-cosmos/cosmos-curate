    """Sample ``canonical`` using one window from ``grid`` and return indices into ``canonical``.

    Window semantics
    ----------------
    This function treats ``window`` as one sampling window emitted by
    :class:`~cosmos_curator.core.sensors.sampling.grid.SamplingGrid`.

    - ``window.timestamps_ns`` are the reference timestamps that belong to the current
      half-open window, and therefore the rows this call produces.
    - ``window.exclusive_end_ns`` is the exclusive right boundary marker.

    The window bounds choose reference timestamps. They do **not** restrict which
    canonical timestamps may serve them: every timestamp in ``canonical`` is
    eligible for every reference timestamp, and matching is plain
    nearest-neighbour. A window is a batching choice, so letting it filter
    ``canonical`` would make the selected data depend on ``stride_ns`` and
    ``duration_ns``.

    Reach is bounded by ``policy.max_delta_ns``, not by any span. Callers that
    can only materialise part of the timeline -- a forward-only decoder, say --
    bound it further by what they pass in ``canonical``; one observation beyond
    each window edge is enough to reproduce whole-timeline selection exactly.

    Return value semantics
    ----------------------
    The returned ``indices`` always refer to the original ``canonical`` array
    passed by the caller, not to an internal filtered sub-array. This allows
    callers to reuse the indices to look up aligned sidecar arrays such as
    ``pts_stream`` or frame payloads that are stored in parallel with
    ``canonical``.

    Args:
        canonical: Full canonical timestamp timeline for one sensor. Must be
            strictly increasing.
        window: One strictly increasing sampling window. window.exclusive_end_ns
            is an exclusive right boundary marker and is not sampled.
        policy: Nearest-timestamp policy. When ``policy.max_delta_ns`` is not
            ``None``, each matched canonical timestamp must be within that
            maximum delta of its reference grid timestamp.
        dedup: Whether to deduplicate repeated canonical picks. When True,
            repeated matches are collapsed and ``counts[i]`` records how many
            reference timestamps mapped to ``canonical[indices[i]]``.

    Returns:
        Tuple ``(indices, counts)``.

        - ``indices`` are indices into the original ``canonical`` array.
        - ``counts`` records multiplicity for each returned canonical index.

        With ``dedup=False`` there is one index per reference timestamp. If the
        window carries no reference timestamps, returns two empty ``int64``
        arrays.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``canonical`` is empty.
        ValueError: If ``canonical`` is not strictly increasing.
        ValueError: If ``window.timestamps_ns`` is not strictly increasing.
        TypeError: If ``policy`` is not a ``NearestTimestampPolicy``.
        ValueError: If ``policy.max_delta_ns`` is not ``None`` and any matched
            canonical timestamp exceeds it from its reference timestamp.
