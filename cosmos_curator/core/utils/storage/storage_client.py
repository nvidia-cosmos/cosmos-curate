    Named for the storage layer rather than for the cloud because the same facts
    describe a local file: ``os.stat`` supplies the size and the modification time,
    and only the entity tag has no local analogue. A caller reporting progress over
    a mix of local paths and cloud URIs then needs one type instead of two.

    Every field is optional because each value is whatever the backend chose to
    report. Both supported backends do report size and last-modified for an object
    that exists, so a ``None`` means the store omitted it rather than that the
    object is absent -- a missing object raises instead of yielding an empty stat.

        size_bytes (int | None): Object size as the store reports it.

            through one client compares cleanly against one from another. Treat it
            as an opaque change token, not a checksum: S3 returns an MD5 for a
            single-part upload but a ``<hash>-<part-count>`` composite for a
            multipart one, so identical bytes can carry different tags. A changed

        paths in this package back off for up to 256 seconds, which is right for a
        transfer that has to succeed but wrong here: absence is a normal answer for

        turn a request for five videos from a production prefix into a full enumeration

        Stopping early is sound here in a way it is not for
        ``s3_client.list_child_prefixes``, whose docstring declines a limit for what
