"""Command-line helpers for tools that accept an ``s3://`` / ``az://`` source.

The bridge between an operator-supplied URI and
:mod:`cosmos_curator.core.utils.storage`: argument parsing, credential resolution
from the *standard AWS* and Curator Azure profile namespaces, actionable errors,
and the ``smart_open`` open a sensor reader needs. It sits outside the
``storage/`` package because it is CLI policy rather than storage mechanism --
nothing in a pipeline stage should reach for an ``argparse`` flag or for the
user-facing error type here.

Credentials deliberately do *not* go through ``s3_client.get_s3_client_config``
or ``azure_client.get_azure_client_config``. Those read Curator's own
``COSMOS_S3_PROFILE_PATH`` / NVCF secret namespace, which is not where an
operator running a CLI keeps credentials, and both import ``nvcf_utils`` and so
``ray``. :class:`~cosmos_curator.core.utils.storage.s3_client.S3ClientConfig` is
therefore constructed directly (it carries ``profile_name``, which names a
section of ``~/.aws/credentials``), and the Azure side goes through
``make_azure_client_config``, which is the ray-free half of that module.

The helpers come in two layers so an instrumentation-heavy caller (see
``benchmarks/sensors/cloud_io_benchmark.py``) can build a client, attach botocore
event hooks to it, and *then* hand it in:

* :func:`make_s3_client` / :func:`make_azure_client` / :func:`make_storage_client`
  resolve credentials and return a ``StorageClient``.
* :func:`open_storage_source` and :func:`list_storage_objects` accept a
  caller-supplied client and reuse it rather than rebuilding one, so any hooks
  attached to it survive.
