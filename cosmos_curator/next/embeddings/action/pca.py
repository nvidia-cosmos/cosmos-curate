"""Action-descriptor PCA basis: pure numpy SVD fit + a content-addressed store.

Reduces the ``DESCRIPTOR_DIM`` (600) dual-wrist descriptor to ``ACTION_DIM`` (97)
with a table-wide basis. ``fit_action_pca`` builds a ``PcaArtifact`` (pure numpy,
no scikit-learn) and ``PcaArtifact.project`` applies it.

``PcaArtifactStore`` persists each basis as an IMMUTABLE, content-addressed
object at ``<root>/<fingerprint>.npz`` (``action_pca_root_uri`` derives the root
directory beside ``clips.lance``). Content addressing decouples the artifact
write from the Lance commit: the basis is persisted before the commit and each
``clips.lance`` row references it by fingerprint, so a failed commit only leaves
a harmless unreferenced object - never new basis bytes paired with old action
vectors. An append reuses the fingerprint the existing rows already carry; a
rebuild fits a new basis under a new fingerprint. The basis records the
``descriptor_version`` it was fit under, so a later run whose descriptor
semantics differ refuses to reuse it.
