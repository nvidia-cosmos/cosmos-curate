"""Ray Data actor for the vision image-embedding leg.

``HfVisionImageEmbedder`` is a Ray Data callable class hosting any HuggingFace
``AutoModel`` vision backbone described by a ``VisionModelSpec``::

    clip_uri --> ClipFrameReader --> AutoImageProcessor --> backbone --> _pool --> L2
                 .read_many(uris)                                                   |
                        |                                             embedding_image
                        +-- unreadable clip: all-NULL group row at the same position

The model + ``AutoImageProcessor`` load once per actor (in ``__init__``, from the
spec's staged weights). Heavy imports (``transformers`` / ``torch``) are deferred
into the constructor so importing this module stays torch-free.

Only the spec is model-specific - the staged checkpoint, its output width, and how
to reduce the backbone output to one vector (``_pool``). Everything else is
generic: the ``backend="torchvision"`` pin makes preprocessing a fixed function of
the checkpoint rather than of whichever backend happens to be importable, and
``ClipFrameReader`` owns the frame acquisition, the concurrency of it, and the
drop-vs-systemic-failure split. Why the reads are concurrent while the backbone
stays one batched call on the calling thread is argued in
``docs/curator/design/curator-next-embeddings.md`` section 4.2.

The leg is cardinality- and order-preserving: a clip whose media is missing or
undecodable emits an all-NULL group row rather than being dropped, so a rebuild
replaces a failed row with NULL instead of leaving a stale prior vector, and the
survivors' vectors are scattered back into their input row positions. The reader
returns each frame under the row it was read from, so that scatter never depends
on the order the reads finished in. The embedder carries no identity column -
attaching ``clip_id`` is the storage layer's job, which is why preserving row
count and order matters here.
