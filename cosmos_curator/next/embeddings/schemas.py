"""Arrow contracts for the embedding column groups on ``clips.lance`` (pure; no Ray/GPU/torch).

The single source of truth for the columns each modality owns on the shared clips
table, the columns each compute batch carries, and the source projection every leg
reads. There is no side table: a modality is a nullable column group added
directly onto ``clips.lance``::

    embedding_text   -> embedding_text_subtask, embedding_text_task
                        (fsl<f32,384>, unit-norm), embedding_text_model_id
    embedding_image  -> embedding_image (fsl<f32,384>, unit-norm),
                        embedding_image_model_id
    embedding_action -> embedding_action (fsl<f32,97>, raw PCA coords - NOT
                        unit-norm), embedding_action_descriptor_version,
                        embedding_action_pca_fingerprint

``EmbeddingColumnGroup`` wraps each group and ``EMBEDDING_COLUMN_GROUPS`` collects
them; any "all embedding columns" view is derived from that tuple, never
hand-maintained. A group is the unit of schema evolution (one ``add_columns``
metadata commit), of selection (its ``primary_vector`` defines "pending"), and of
publication (all its fields are written by one ``update_columns`` call).

Batches carry NO identity column. The group builders (``text_columns_batch`` /
``image_columns_batch`` / ``action_columns_batch``) return exactly one group's
fields, one row per input row, in input order. The caller that owns storage
attaches ``clip_id`` positionally - keeping the embedders pure compute that never
sees a key. Image and action carry a per-row ``valid`` mask so a decode or
geometry failure persists as an all-NULL (pending / retryable) group instead of
dropping the row; that cardinality-preserving contract is what lets the
positional key attachment be correct. Text has no mask (it never fails per row).

Stored-vector SCALE differs by modality and is part of the contract even though it
is not recorded in Arrow metadata: text and image vectors are **L2-normalized**
(cosine == dot product), while action vectors are **raw PCA coordinates** (NOT
unit-norm - magnitude encodes gesture size). Normalization is a property of the
model spec, so a future cross-modality fusion resolves scale from the spec rather
than from a schema tag; it must not mix the two.

Embedding and provenance columns are nullable and start NULL: NULL means "not
computed", and the companion provenance column (``*_model_id`` for the model
modalities, ``*_descriptor_version`` / ``*_pca_fingerprint`` for action) is NULL
alongside it. Vectors use ``fixed_size_list`` (not variable ``list``): it fixes
the width as a schema guarantee, lets a mixed-width model swap fail loud, and is
the type a Lance vector index requires. The list child is left nullable
(pyarrow's default) so an all-NULL column is a legal column value.

    Args:
        action_uris: The ``action_data_uri`` each row came from (``None`` for a row
            that carried no artifact, preserved rather than collapsed to ``""``); its
            length defines the batch's row count. The PCA fit sample de-duplicates on
            this so a multi-view span contributes its descriptor once, not once per view.
        descriptors: ``(len(action_uris), descriptor_dim)`` raw descriptors;
            invalid-row values are masked out.
        descriptor_dim: Descriptor width.
        valid: Per-row validity mask (False -> NULL descriptor).

    Returns:
        A table matching ``DESCRIPTOR_ROW``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``descriptors`` or ``valid`` does not align with
            ``action_uris``.
