"""Ray Data actor for the text-embedding leg.

``SentenceTransformerTextEmbedder`` is a Ray Data callable class hosting any
model describable by a ``TextModelSpec``: the ``SentenceTransformer`` model loads
once per actor (in ``__init__``, from the spec's staged weights, on the target
device) and each ``__call__`` embeds one Arrow batch. Nothing here is
model-specific - ``SentenceTransformer(dir)`` plus ``encode(normalize_embeddings=
True)`` is the library contract for every checkpoint it hosts. The heavy
``sentence_transformers`` import is deferred into the constructor so importing
this module (e.g. in a CPU-only test) does not pull torch.

Each source clip yields two vectors - the subtask instruction and its parent
task - both L2-normalized (``normalize_embeddings=True``) so downstream cosine
distance is a plain dot product. This dual task/subtask output is the one
domain-specific part of the leg. The leg never drops a row: task / subtask are
non-null on the source contract, and an empty instruction embeds to a valid
(content-free) vector.

The embedder is pure compute and carries no identity column: it reads the text
columns and returns only the text group's columns, one row per input row in input
order. Attaching ``clip_id`` is the storage layer's job.

The retrieval instruction prefix that BGE-style models document (e.g.
"Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages:") is deliberately NOT
prepended: this leg embeds for symmetric clustering, where both sides are the
same kind of text, not asymmetric query-vs-passage retrieval. Do not "fix" it.
