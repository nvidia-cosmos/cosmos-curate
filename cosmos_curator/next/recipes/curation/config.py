"""Typed config for the Curate leg: one flat model plus two invariant carriers.

::

    CurateConfig            the whole operator-settable surface
      +- weights            ModalityWeights  - must sum to 1
      +- target             SelectionTarget   - at most one form set

A sub-model exists here if and only if it carries a CROSS-FIELD invariant. Both
that survive do: the fused vector is unit-norm only when the weights sum to 1,
and a target expressed twice has no single answer. Everything else is a leaf on
``CurateConfig``, because grouping leaves by theme buys nothing a name does not
already say and costs every caller an extra hop.

Strict, frozen, and ``extra="forbid"``, which is what makes a migration safe
rather than silent: a config still naming a removed key such as ``staging_root``
fails at parse time with the offending key named, instead of being ignored and
running with a default the operator did not choose.

A resolved config is also the run's IDENTITY: ``result_defining_digest`` hashes
every field that decides an outcome, and the write stamps that digest on the
commit so a committed table version can name the rules that produced it. The
excluded fields are a deny-list, so a field added here joins the identity by
default rather than needing to be remembered.

``resolve_config`` is the single entry point every config-driven surface goes
through - ``pipeline validate``, ``pipeline render``, and ``run-pipeline`` all
resolve here - so one file plus its ``--set`` overrides can never mean two
different things depending on which command read it. ``strict=True`` makes the
override parsing load-bearing rather than incidental: values are read as YAML, so
``target_mean_cluster_rows=200000`` resolves to an int and passes, while a quoted
``"200000"`` is rejected instead of being coerced.

        byte-identical text whatever order their config files listed.

        This is the run's identity: two versions carrying different digests are
        not comparable, and two carrying the same digest applied the same RULES -
        the config fields plus the declarations the contract half enumerates.
        That is narrower than "selected for the same thing": the fit-sample prefix
        rule decides which rows the locality basis is fitted on, so it moves every
        cluster id, and no config field or contract entry names it. The COMMIT
        separates two such runs anyway, on the ``centroids_fingerprint`` stamped
        beside this digest - a different prefix fits a different basis, whose
        bytes hash differently - so the two properties are read together; see
        ``pipeline._commit_properties``.

        The text this hashes is archived beside the table, so a reader can
        recompute the value and see WHERE two runs differ rather than only that
        they do.
