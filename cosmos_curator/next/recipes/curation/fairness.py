"""Fairness: which task gets its share, decided on LABEL SEMANTICS, never on the fused metric.

Curate carries two distinct geometries, computed over different metrics, and this
module owns exactly one of them. LOCALITY (``curate_cluster_id``) is a k-means
partition of the FUSED vector and answers "is this row a near-duplicate of that
one". FAIRNESS is the ``(canonical task, subtask cluster)`` pair and answers "did
this task get its share".

Distinct is not independent, and the difference matters when reading a report.
The two keys share information by construction, because the fused vector weights
subtask text at 0.6 and the level-2 cell is k-means over that same embedding:
their measured normalized mutual information is 0.50, with 55% of the fairness key
already fixed once the locality cluster is known. What follows from that is only
that neither may be read as the other - they are NOT interchangeable. It has no
operational consequence, because nothing here reads a cluster: ``FairnessQuota``
is built from ``survivor_group_counts`` alone.

The direction that would be a defect is the reverse one, and it is a measurement
rather than a preference: the action block funds 0.2 of the fused metric and
carries no task signal at all (task-separation ratio 0.990, same-task-closer AUC
0.543 on 131,602 clips with repaired labels), so no function of the fused vector
can stand in for a task identity.

The separation is between the two METRICS, not between strings and vectors. Both
levels here are functions of the label's own text embedding - the one block that
does carry label semantics, measured at AUC 0.853 - and neither ever reads the
fused vector. Level 1 folds the task vocabulary pairwise, because the annotation
schema bounds it (2,738 distinct tasks measured). Level 2 PARTITIONS the subtask
text embedding into ``subtask_clusters`` cells, because its vocabulary is
free-form annotator prose that grows with the corpus: at ~0.816 distinct labels
per row a pairwise fold over it is both a quadratic driver kernel and a group
count no quota can divide.

Four steps, in this order, each a pure function here and wired by ``pipeline``::

    scan     canonicalize_label per row     -> __canonical_task   (level 1 key)
      |      nearest subtask centroid       -> __subtask_cluster  (level 2 key)
      v
    merge    merge_labels once over the DISTINCT TASK labels at merge_theta_task
      |      (driver, O(distinct tasks) state). apply_label_merge then REWRITES
      |      __canonical_task to its representative, so every later step - the
      |      count, the shuffle key, and the cut - sees the merged task.
      v
    count    survivor_group_counts -> per-group capacity, survivors only
      |
      v
    quota    FairnessQuota.build(...).quotas() -> one integer per group
      |
      v
    cut      select_within_quota per group -> selected / below_quota / unfunded

Level 2 has no merge stage and needs none. A merge exists to put two spellings of
one instruction in one group, and a partition of the same embedding does that
already and more aggressively - two spellings of one instruction sit at cosine
~0.99 and land in one cell of 16. The stronger reason is structural: a merge is
driven by one vector per DISTINCT label, which only a driver-side gather over the
whole vocabulary can produce, and that gather is the O(L) state this key was
bounded to remove. Assigning per ROW at the scan is what makes the level-2 key
cost nothing on the driver at all.

``quotas()`` guarantees six properties, and the suite asserts each as an
identity rather than by example:

1. Exact total: quotas sum to ``min(target, total)``.
2. Capacity: ``0 <= quota[g] <= capacity[g]``.
3. Coverage, WITHIN a tier: every group gets one before any gets a second, and at
   a target below the tier's group count exactly ``target`` of its groups are
   funded, whatever their size, chosen by that tier's residual order. Nesting
   weakens it across the two: a task holding one cell spends its whole parent
   share there, so a target equal to the level-2 group count does not promise
   every cell a clip.
4. Uniformity: unsaturated quotas differ by at most one.
5. Determinism: the keys and the seed decide every boundary, so input row order
   cannot reach the result.
6. No float arithmetic anywhere in the allocation.

Size never enters an order: ``capacity`` is consulted only for saturation, so the
tie-break that DENIES representation cannot depend on size any more than the
quota itself does. ``FairnessQuota.build`` normalizes the keys into ascending
order once, which leaves no comparator downstream to get wrong and makes each
parent's children contiguous, so the nested pass reads one slice per parent.

What the ascending key order must NOT decide is who wins the remainder, and at
``target`` below a tier's group count the remainder is the whole allocation. Both
tiers therefore fund their remainder by ``residual_ranks``, a seeded digest, and
each has its own correlation that the key order would otherwise fold into the
selected set:

- Level 1 hashes the LABEL. Canonical task labels are verb-initial annotation
  prose, so their alphabet is ordered by action type: funding a prefix of it drops
  whole families of instructions together, and drops the same families on every
  run.
- Level 2 hashes the ``(task, cell)`` PAIR. A fitted cell id is an arbitrary
  index, but it is a GLOBAL one, so ascending cell id is the same order under
  every parent - a cell that loses its task's last place loses it under every
  task at once, and whole regions of subtask meaning reach the selected set with
  no clips at all. Hashing the pair rather than the cell is what decorrelates the
  tiers from each other: the loss still falls somewhere, but not on the same cell
  everywhere.

Within ONE pass the unfunded count is identical under any order, because the fill
line is a function of the capacity multiset and the target alone. Nesting leaves a
residue: the level-1 residual decides which parents win an extra row, and parents
differ in occupied-cell count, so a swapped parent moves the level-2 total by one.
The variation is bounded by the level-1 REMAINDER, which is not small - a corpus
mixing one-cell and five-cell tasks moves the count by tens of groups across seeds.
That makes the count an even weaker detector of either correlation, not a stronger
one: it is a scarcity reading, never a comparator reading.

The allocation is nested rather than flat because neither single pass is fair at
both granularities: a flat pass over the ``(task, subtask)`` pairs lets a task win
by owning more subtasks, while a pass over tasks alone never guarantees that each
subtask is covered. Both levels and the target are run-invariant state, and the
two levels must derive from identical inputs or they disagree about how much a
parent received.

The two verdicts a losing row can carry differ in what lost it: ``unfunded``
means the group's quota is zero - the water-fill never funded the group at all
- while ``below_quota`` means the group was funded and this row ranked outside
its share.

Group identity is deliberately not persisted, so ``below_quota`` and ``unfunded``
are not auditable from stored state: recovering "which group" needs the task label
set, the task threshold, the clip counts that ordered the representatives, and
the centroid artifact that fixed the subtask cells. Reproducibility rests entirely
on this module being deterministic, which is why every ordering here is total.
The concessions are transient WARNINGs. A task merge that folds away most of its
vocabulary says so, because a mis-set threshold would otherwise redistribute a
large part of the corpus with nothing anywhere recording that it did. Starvation
says so too, and separately per level, because the two levels starve for
different reasons and answer to different knobs: a target below the task count is
not a ``subtask_clusters`` problem and cannot be fixed by changing it.

# therefore MEASURES that regime, where a maximum over the quotas only stands in
# for it: one task with too few rows to populate subtask_clusters cells
# contributes a single cell holding that whole task's level-1 quota, so a handful
# of small tasks lift the maximum clear of any threshold while the corpus is still

# within one pass the count below is the same under any order, and nesting leaves
# only a residue bounded by the level-1 remainder (see the module docstring). So
# this line measures scarcity and is not weakened by the comparator, even though
# reseeding can move it by tens of groups on a corpus of mixed cell occupancy.
# A measured sweep is what moved it: at a target of 5%
# of survivors 24.4% of groups received nothing, and at 3.8% it was 36.3% - both
# silent at a halving factor, and neither is a regime an operator would want to
# discover from the selected set.
#
# It is a SMALL-CORPUS signal either way. At production scale (250M rows, ~2,738
# tasks, 16 cells) G is bounded near 46,500 against a multi-million target, so
# every group is funded, unfunded is zero, and this line is silent whatever the
# factor. What it catches is a pilot run, or a k set far too high for the corpus
# it was pointed at.
#
# This does NOT overlap _MERGE_COLLAPSE_WARN_FACTOR, which fires on too FEW
# level-1 groups (a task merge that folded away most of its vocabulary). This
# regime is caused by too MANY level-2 groups: more cells than the target can
# reach. The two can hold at once and mean opposite things, so neither warning
# can be widened to cover the other. Since the level-2 key became a bounded
# partition this line is also the run-time read-out for subtask_clusters: it
# fires when k * distinct tasks is large against the target.
#
# It is a BACKSTOP rather than the primary check, because the same condition is
# computable before a run: a parent starves cells exactly when its budget,
# approximately target / MERGED tasks, falls below the number of cells it
# OCCUPIES - at most k, and less for a task too small to populate them all. A k
# modestly above that quotient is already allocated by the residual order while
# staying under a fifth, so silence here does not certify the value. The operator-facing
