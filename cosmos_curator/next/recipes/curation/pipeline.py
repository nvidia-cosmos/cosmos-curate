"""Curate's Lance and Ray layer: the whole leg, from preflight to the one commit.

The geometry, the retention rule and the quota arithmetic live in the pure
kernels beside this module (``vectors``, ``dedup``, ``fairness``); what is owned
here is the distributed plumbing and every place Curate touches the table's
manifest. ``clips.lance`` is read once, widened with the two nullable
``curate_*`` columns in a metadata-only commit, and finally rebound for the
fragments that carried an eligible row - all in one transaction.

        v
    _commit    ONE Transaction(Update(updated_fragments, fields_modified))

The write is TOTAL: every row of every fragment is written on every run, so both
columns always describe the run that committed last and NULL has exactly one
meaning - "the latest run did not claim this row". Three properties make that
cheap and safe:

- ``update_columns`` writes a new file holding only the two columns, for the
  fragment's existing rows in their existing offset order. No row is replaced,
  so no deletion vector is written and every row address survives.
- The join is left-outer on the ordinary persisted ``clip_id``, which is why an
  unclaimed row must be present carrying NULL rather than merely omitted: an
  omitted row keeps its previous value, an explicitly NULL one is overwritten.
- ``fields_modified`` scopes the rebinding to Curate's two field ids, so every
  other column - source fields and ``embedding_*`` alike - stays bound to the
  file it already had.

Totality is what makes a re-run over a SHRUNK eligible set safe. A verdict is not
a per-row computation, so a row curated by an earlier run under looser weights
would otherwise survive indistinguishable from a current one, and the table's
selected count could exceed the target this run was given.

The commit is ALL-OR-NOTHING, and this is where Curate deliberately parts from
the embeddings leg, which skips a failed fragment and commits the rest. A Curate
verdict is not a per-row computation: ``below_quota`` and ``unfunded`` are
decided against a corpus-global quota, so committing the fragments that happened
to succeed would publish verdicts derived from a population that was never
written. A failure therefore propagates out of the worker and the run ends with
no verdict published - narrower than "the table untouched", because a run that
is the first to curate a table has already committed the preflight's
metadata-only schema widening. That version stamps no ``kind``, so no reader
counts it as a curate run.

The commit carries the run's IDENTITY, and nothing more: the leg's ``kind``, the
config generation, a digest of every config field that decides an outcome, and the
content fingerprint of the basis those outcomes were assigned against. That
artifact archives the text the digest is taken over, so a reader who finds two
versions with different digests can see which field moved.

That commit is therefore the ONLY boundary at which a verdict becomes visible -
the preflight widening above publishes names, never values. Every object the
verdict commit names - the two rebound column files and the basis - is durable
before it lands,
so there is no window in which a verdict is readable while what produced it is
still being written, and no failure mode that needs a repair path the run's own
in-memory state is the only source for. The basis is named by its own hash instead
of by the version it produced, which is what allows it to be written first: a
version-derived name cannot be computed until the commit that would depend on it
has already happened.

Two passes read the corpus, not one, and the second is what keeps the first
narrow. The main lineage must never carry a 384-wide text vector past the scan,
because everything after it shuffles; the task merge nonetheless needs one vector
per distinct task label. So the gather is its own reduction that projects the task
text vector and emits O(distinct tasks) rows, and the main scan reads the subtask
vector but reduces it to one int32 cell before yielding. Fusing the two into one
pass would put the widest column in the run through the dedup shuffle to save a
read of one column.

Every driver-side intermediate is bounded by config or by the annotation schema
rather than by the corpus. The label gather reduces the TASK vocabulary, which the
schema fixes; the quota's group table is at most distinct merged tasks times
``subtask_clusters + 1``; the metric report is a fixed bin count. The level-2 key
is a partition of the subtask embedding computed per row inside the scan, so the
free-form subtask vocabulary - which would otherwise be the merge's input size,
the quota's group count and a shuffle key at once - never reaches the driver in
any form.

nothing - and a ZERO vector rather than a NULL one, because ``dedup`` rejects a

(verified on Ray 2.55.1) and the group count deliberately relies on that for
``curate_selection_reason``, which is NULL for exactly the survivors
``fairness.survivor_group_counts`` keeps. A nullable cell would instead widen that
one key type to ``int | None`` in three places that have to agree on it.

    Ray describes each output PARTITION independently, and a partition that saw
    only part of the data describes only that part, so two blocks of one
    reduction can disagree about the table they belong to in two ways:

    - An EMPTY partition carries no schema at all - zero columns, no field names
      - not a zero-row copy of its siblings'. Every partition past the number of
      distinct groups is empty, and the default partition count far exceeds the
      handful of groups either caller reduces to, so most blocks are these.
    - A partition whose rows all hold NULL in a nullable group key types that key
      ``null``, while a sibling that observed a value types it ``string``. Curate
      reaches this every run: ``curate_selection_reason`` is NULL for exactly the
      survivors, which is nearly every row, so a partition holding no reasoned
      row is the common case rather than the corner.

    Empty partitions are therefore dropped rather than unified - they carry no
    row to keep and no type to learn from - and the surviving blocks agree on a
    schema by promoting ``null`` to a type a sibling actually observed. A
    disagreement between two CONCRETE types, or a populated block whose field set
    differs, means the blocks really do describe different tables and is left to
    fail. That last part is what rules out
    ``pa.concat_tables(..., promote_options="permissive")``: it would absorb both
    of the shapes above and a genuine drift alike, turning a lost column into an
