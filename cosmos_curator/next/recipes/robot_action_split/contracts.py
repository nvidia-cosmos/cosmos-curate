# Bump when CLIP_SCHEMA's field set or meaning changes. v3 renamed the former
# OUTCOME_SCHEMA to CLIP_SCHEMA, matching video_split's successes-only shape:
# dropped status/error_stage/error_message (failures now go to a separate
# errors.json report, never to Lance), tightened clip_uri/action_data_uri to
# non-nullable, and added record_schema_version/media_contract_version columns
# for cross-run reconciliation integrity checks. The embed leg only reads
# clip_id/task_name/subtask_name/clip_uri/action_data_uri/source_dataset by
# name (see docs/curator/design/curator-next-embeddings.md), all unaffected.
