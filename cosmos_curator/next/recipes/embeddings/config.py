"""Typed config for the embedding recipe (pydantic; no business logic).

Embedding-specific knobs only: which modalities run, per-modality resources, the
shared ``clips.lance`` table (both the read source and the write target), and the
dev fragment cap. There is no output-table, side-table, or PCA-artifact
URI: the recipe updates ``clips.lance`` in place and derives the action-PCA
artifact directory from it. Validation is strict (unknown keys rejected, no silent
coercion) so a malformed config fails at assembly on the driver rather than deep
inside a Ray Data actor.

``resolve_config`` is the single entry point every config-driven surface goes
through - ``pipeline validate``, ``pipeline render``, and ``run-pipeline`` all
resolve here - so one file plus its ``--set`` overrides can never mean two
different things depending on which command read it.

Every modality's ``batch_size`` is its WORKER'S FRAGMENT-SCAN batch size - how
many rows of one Lance fragment reach the embedder per call. It is not a Ray Data
work-item size: a work item is always exactly one fragment.
