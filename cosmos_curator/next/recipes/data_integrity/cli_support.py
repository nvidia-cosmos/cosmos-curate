"""The argparse surface, exit codes and Ctrl-C handling both data-integrity CLIs share.

Shared by the single-video ``di-check`` CLI (:mod:`.cli`) and the single-session
``di-session`` tool (:mod:`.session_cli`) so that a policy flag never means two
different things, an exit code never has two variants of the same status, and an
operator abort behaves identically whichever entry point they ran.

``Thresholds`` / ``DEFAULT_THRESHOLDS`` are re-exported from here for callers that
already import the policy alongside the flags that populate it; they are defined in
:mod:`cosmos_curator.core.sensors.data_integrity.instruments`.

The compute this wraps lives in
:mod:`cosmos_curator.core.sensors.data_integrity.engine`, and the URI-level IO in
:mod:`.sources`.

    The first Ctrl-C only sets the event; it deliberately does not raise. Python's
    default handler raises ``KeyboardInterrupt`` wherever the interpreter happens to
    be, and under this CLI that is usually inside one of libav's IO callbacks -- which
    cannot carry a Python exception back out. What the operator gets instead is a
    swallowed exception printed as a traceback, followed by libav either relabelling
    the abort as an ``InvalidDataError`` (blaming the file) or recovering and finishing
    the run as though nothing had been asked of it. Neither is an interruption.

    So the stop is cooperative: readers abandon their source at the next boundary they
    control (:func:`cancellable_reader`) and callers consult the event to decide the
    outcome. Nothing is raised through libav, so nothing is printed by it.

    A second Ctrl-C raises ``KeyboardInterrupt`` in the classic way, on the assumption
    that an operator pressing it again wants out regardless of the mess -- the escape
    hatch for anything that never reaches a read, such as a stalled bucket listing.

    An event rather than a flag because worker threads read it too: only the main
    thread receives the signal. The previous handler is restored on exit, keeping this
    usable inside a library caller's process, and installation is only valid on the
    main thread, which is where :mod:`signal` permits it.

    turns an abandoned session's tail from "as long as the largest in-flight file still
    needs" into a single read's worth of latency. The check precedes the call so no
    further range request is issued; the read already in progress still has to return.

    Cancellation surfaces as end-of-file rather than as an exception because libav
    cannot carry a Python exception out of its read callback: raising leaves the process
    printing an unraisable-exception traceback for every abandoned stream, whereas a
    short read is something a demuxer already knows how to end on. Reporting a source
    as shorter than it is would be dangerous if anyone trusted the resulting index, so

    (see :func:`~cosmos_curator.next.recipes.data_integrity.session_runner.run_session`).

    pattern PyAV uses, ``readable`` / ``seekable`` report the wrapped stream's own
