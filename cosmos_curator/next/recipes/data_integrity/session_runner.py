"""Run the data-integrity engine over the streams of a single session.

The per-stream work -- wiring the metric kernel and judging each measurement -- is
the shared engine in :mod:`cosmos_curator.core.sensors.data_integrity.engine`,
reached through :mod:`.sources`, which opens the source it is pointed at. This
module adds only the session layer on top of them: :func:`run_session` discovers a
session's streams, runs the shared engine on each, classifies open/decode failures
as a per-stream ``ERROR``, judges the session as a whole with
:func:`session_metrics`, and aggregates the results into a :class:`SessionReport`.

:func:`run_one_stream` is the per-stream unit :func:`run_session` is built from --
open one source, measure it, and turn a failure into that stream's ``ERROR`` rather
than the run's. It is public because the Ray Data pipeline distributes exactly that
unit and must not grow a second copy of the failure contract. The one thing the two
callers disagree about is which failures are the stream's at all: see
``raise_infrastructure_errors`` and :class:`InfrastructureError`.

:func:`run_stream` is a thin convenience over
:func:`~cosmos_curator.core.sensors.data_integrity.engine.run_metrics` for an
already-open sensor, packaging its output as a :class:`StreamResult`.
