"""Turn the ``input`` config block into the session paths one run covers.

Three forms -- an explicit list, a file of paths, and dataset roots to expand --
unioned into one deduplicated, sorted tuple. Deduplication is not cosmetic: two
spellings of one session would be measured twice and then collide on ``stream_id``
with nothing to break the tie, quietly dropping one session's provenance (see the
"One source reached twice in one run" section of the design doc).

Expansion happens on the driver, before Ray, because an input that resolves to
nothing is a configuration error and should be reported as one rather than as a
successful run that measured zero streams.
