# exists:
#
#   alias di-session="$VENV/bin/python -m cosmos_curator.next.recipes.data_integrity.session_cli"
#
# Run against one session (a clips/<uuid>/ directory or cloud prefix):
#
#   di-session --session-path /path/to/clips/<uuid>
#   di-session --session-path s3://bucket/clips/<uuid>/ --s3-profile-name my-profile --json
#   di-session --session-path s3://hyperion8/clips/<uuid>/ --endpoint-url <endpoint-url> --limit 5
#

"""Run every data-integrity metric against every stream of a single session.

A *session* is one recording -- typically a ``clips/<uuid>/`` directory (or cloud
prefix) holding one video per camera. This CLI discovers those streams, runs the
shared per-stream engine
(:mod:`cosmos_curator.core.sensors.data_integrity.engine`) on each, and prints
a per-stream + session-level verdict. It is the session-level companion to the
single-video ``di-check`` CLI (:mod:`.cli`) and reuses the same engine, cloud
credential flags, and reason strings.
