r"""Ray Data entry point for the Curator Next ``data-integrity`` recipe.

The only module in the recipe that imports Ray, so
``python -m cosmos_curator.next.recipes.data_integrity.cli --help`` stays Ray-free.

One stage, one commit. Each task takes one session, lists it and measures every
stream in it, and every Lance write stays on the driver -- concurrent ``append_rows``
from many workers would race on create-or-append, which is a problem worth not
having.

Nothing a session hits fails the run before the commit. A session that could not be
listed, or a stream that could not be reached, comes back as a count on that session's
record; the driver commits what was measured and only then raises
:class:`IncompleteRunError`, so short coverage costs the run its exit status but not
its rows.

Usage::

    python -m cosmos_curator.next.recipes.data_integrity.pipeline config.yaml
