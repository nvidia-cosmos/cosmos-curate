"""Curator Next ``data-integrity`` recipe: the CLIs, discovery and store around the metrics.

The reusable half -- the metrics themselves, their pass/fail policy and the
per-stream engine that runs them -- lives in
:mod:`cosmos_curator.core.sensors.data_integrity`. What lives here is everything
that makes those metrics a Cosmos Curator workflow: the ``di-check`` and
``di-session`` entry points, cloud/local stream discovery, the concurrent session
runner, report rendering, the Lance-backed result store, and the
``check_video_index`` diagnostic.

See ``docs/curator/design/data-integrity-design.md`` for the architecture and the
metric catalog. Callers import from concrete module paths; this package does not
re-export symbols.
