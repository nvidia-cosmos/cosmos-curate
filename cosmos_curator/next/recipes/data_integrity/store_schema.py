"""Arrow schemas for the data-integrity store.

Four kinds of dataset, described in full in
``docs/curator/design/data-integrity-store-schema.md``:

* ``stream.lance`` -- one row per stream a run touched, *including* ones that could
  not be opened. A stream that fails to open produces no measurements, so without
  this dataset the broken stream would vanish from the store entirely.
* ``measurements/<metric>.lance`` -- one row per stream, one dataset per metric,
  with the measured fields as native typed columns.
* ``evaluation.lance`` -- one row per policy x stream x metric. The one tall
  dataset, because verdicts have a uniform shape whatever produced them.
* ``run.lance`` -- one row per *finished* run. Written last, so it is what makes a
  run's rows visible; see :func:`~.store.commit_run`.

Measurement columns are typed rather than packed into a JSON payload so that
``NaN`` needs no encoding: JSON cannot represent it, but Arrow stores it natively
as a float64 bit pattern and keeps null in a separate validity bitmap. That gives
three distinct states for free -- null (the metric never ran), ``NaN`` (it ran and
the value is undefined), and a real value -- where a JSON payload would need a
hand-written sentinel contract and would quietly degrade the middle one into the
first.

Every metric column is nullable regardless of whether the measurement itself can
produce a null, because a "never ran" row carries the identity columns and nothing
else. ``InstrumentSpec.fields`` is what records whether a null is a value the
metric can legitimately produce.
