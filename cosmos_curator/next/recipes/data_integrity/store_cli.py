"""The ``--store-path`` surface shared by both data-integrity CLIs.

Kept apart from :mod:`.cli_support` for one reason: the store pulls in ``lance`` and
``pyarrow``, and a plain check should not pay for them. Everything here imports the
store lazily, inside the call, so the cost lands only on a run that actually asked
to persist.
