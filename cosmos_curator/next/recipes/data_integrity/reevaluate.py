"""Re-judge stored measurements under a new policy, without re-reading any source.

This is what the store is for. A measurement is a fact about the data and does not
change; a verdict is a judgment about that fact and changes whenever the thresholds
do. So tightening a threshold reads the stored facts, runs the *same* evaluation
path the CLIs use (:func:`~.instruments.evaluate_metric`), and appends a new
generation of verdicts under a new ``policy_id``. No source is opened, and the
previous verdicts stay exactly where they were.

The new rows carry ``run_id`` for the re-judging invocation and
``measurement_run_id`` for the run whose facts were judged, so
``run_id <> measurement_run_id`` isolates everything that was re-evaluated rather
than measured.
