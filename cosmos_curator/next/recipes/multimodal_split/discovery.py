"""Driver-side candidate session discovery for Curator Next ``multimodal-split``.

Discovery turns the configured input location into a deterministic PyArrow table
of candidate sessions for the first Ray Data stage. It deliberately stops at the
session boundary: it does not resolve camera, IMU, GPS, or calibration artifact
paths, check that any artifact exists, or decode media. Those belong to the
splitting stage.

The production output is a ``pyarrow.Table`` rather than a sequence of Python
session objects because a large run may discover millions of sessions, and one
Python object per session would add avoidable Ray Data serialization, copying,
and garbage-collection overhead.

A ``session_uri`` is the configured prefix with a session ID appended: an
``s3://`` URI for remote input and an absolute filesystem path for local input.
Both forms are accepted directly by the storage helpers and the sensor library,
so the splitting stage can join artifact patterns onto them without converting
anything first.

    With ``input_path_prefix`` alone, the immediate children of the prefix are the
    candidate sessions. When ``session_id_list_path`` is also set, the session IDs
    are read from that file instead and joined to the prefix without listing it.

    In both modes the IDs are deduplicated and sorted before ``limit`` is applied,
    so a given configuration and input always produce the same rows in the same
    order.

    In session-ID-list mode the prefix is only a join base and is never listed or
    checked for existence, so a prefix that does not exist yields rows rather than
    an error. Confirming that a session is real is the splitting stage's job.

    A candidate is not guaranteed to be a distinct recording. Local listing
    follows symlinks, so a ``latest -> session-a`` convention produces two
    candidates for one recording; see ``_list_local_child_session_ids``. A caller
    that must not process a recording twice should deduplicate by resolved target
    rather than assuming session IDs are one-to-one with recordings.

    The returned table becomes a single Ray Data block, because ``from_arrow``
    maps one table to one block regardless of how the table is chunked. A caller
    wanting parallelism across a large selection should repartition it.
