"""Private run state for managed Slurm-Ray clusters.

This module is the single authority for the run manifest: its schema, its state machine, its lock, and every
mutation that may be applied to it. It uses only the Python standard library so that one implementation can serve
all three hosts that write run state:

- the client and the in-container head supervisor import it directly, and
- submission uploads this file verbatim into the private run directory, where a login or compute host without a
  Cosmos Curator installation executes it as ``python3 slurm_ray_state.py``.

One ``flock`` on ``manifest.lock`` protects every write. No caller holds it across round trips: each mutation takes
the lock, re-reads state, and is accepted or refused against the state machine below, which is what orders one
lifecycle operation against another.

See :mod:`.` for the Python floor this module is held to and why it differs from the rest of the codebase.
