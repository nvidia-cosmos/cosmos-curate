"""vLLM model ids.

This module provides model ids for a model variant.

Originally, these IDs were included in two places, which causes confusion.
The reason was to solve the problem of the vllm package not being available in
the default conda environment, which is used when building pipelines.

Instead, these IDs have been moved to a separate file, which can be imported
by each plugin, and by vllm_caption_stages.py, in the default conda
environment.

This allows for a location for variant -> model id mapping.
