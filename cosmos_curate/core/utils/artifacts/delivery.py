r"""Generic artifact delivery: staging, cross-node collection, and upload.

Provides :class:`ArtifactDelivery` -- a single, consumer-agnostic
orchestrator for the full artifact lifecycle on a distributed
compute cluster.  It sits one layer above :class:`RayFileTransport`
(which handles raw file transport between nodes) and
:class:`StorageWriter` (which handles upload to local / S3 / Azure
destinations)::

    (collector.py) (storage_utils.py)

Multiple subsystems (profiling backends, OTel tracing, and
potentially future ones) need the same three-phase lifecycle:

1. **Before** the pipeline: ensure a shared staging environment
   variable (``COSMOS_CURATE_ARTIFACTS_STAGING_DIR``) is set so all
   worker processes write artifacts to a known local directory.
2. **Before** ``ray.shutdown()``: gather staged files from every
   node and upload them to the final output directory.
3. **Upload** uses :class:`StorageWriter` -- local paths, S3, and
   Azure are handled transparently.

Collection strategy is chosen automatically based on the
destination:

- **Remote** (S3 / Azure): each worker node uploads directly via
  its own ``StorageWriter``, eliminating the driver-hop that would
  otherwise double network transfer.
- **Local**: files are gathered to the driver via
  ``RayFileTransport``, then written locally via ``StorageWriter``.

::

    Remote destination (S3 / Azure)
    ===============================

    Worker A: staging/ --+--> StorageWriter --> S3
    Worker B: staging/ --+--> StorageWriter --> S3
    Worker C: staging/ --+--> StorageWriter --> S3
        (each node uploads directly; driver only coordinates)

    Local destination
    =================

    Worker A: staging/ --+
    Worker B: staging/ --+--> RayFileTransport --> driver --> StorageWriter --> local dir
    Worker C: staging/ --+
        (files gathered to driver first, then written locally)

Before this module existed, each subsystem duplicated this logic
independently.  ``ArtifactDelivery`` replaces those duplicates with
a single parameterised implementation -- behaviour is controlled
entirely by constructor arguments (``kind``, ``upload_subdir``,
``collect_on_shutdown``), with zero knowledge of any specific
subsystem.

Example::

    from cosmos_curate.core.utils.artifacts.delivery import ArtifactDelivery

    # Auto-collect at shutdown (default):
    ArtifactDelivery.create(
        kind="profiling",
        output_dir="/output/profiles",
    )

    # On-demand collection (consumer controls timing):
    delivery = ArtifactDelivery.create(
        kind="traces",
        output_dir="s3://bucket/profiles",
        upload_subdir="traces",
        collect_on_shutdown=False,
    )
    # ... run pipeline ...
    delivery.collect()  # explicit call

class _NodeUploader:

    Deployed on each worker node via ``NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy``
    so it reads files from the local staging directory and uploads
    them directly to the remote destination via ``StorageWriter``.

    Design decisions:
        - ``num_cpus=0``: upload is I/O-bound (network to S3/Azure),
          not CPU-bound.  Requesting zero CPUs avoids displacing
          pipeline actors during post-pipeline collection.
        - One actor per node: mirrors the ``_NodeCollector`` pattern
          from ``RayFileTransport``.  Each actor handles all files
          on its node to amortize actor creation overhead.
        - ``StorageWriter`` constructed on the worker: each node
          creates its own ``StorageWriter`` instance, which resolves
          the S3/Azure client locally.  The driver never transfers
          file bytes -- only the destination path and credentials
          profile cross the actor boundary.
        - Concurrent intra-node uploads: files are uploaded via a
          ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` so multiple network-I/O-bound
          uploads run in parallel within the actor.  The thread
          pool wraps ``StorageWriter.upload_file_to()`` which
          includes built-in retry logic (``do_with_retries``).

            Both ``boto3`` and ``azure-storage-blob`` clients are
            thread-safe for independent upload operations.

        Error handling:
            Controlled by the ``strict`` parameter:

            - ``strict=False`` (default): individual file failures
              are caught per-file and recorded in the ``errors``
              tuple.  Remaining files continue uploading -- a single
              poisoned file does NOT abort the entire node's upload.
              Partial delivery is preferable to zero delivery for
              diagnostic artifacts.

            - ``strict=True``: the first file failure cancels all
              pending futures and raises ``ArtifactDeliveryError``
              immediately.  The caller (typically ``_collect_remote``
              via ``ray.get()``) receives the exception and can
              implement fail-fast semantics.

        Edge cases:
            - Non-existent staging directory: returns immediately
              with ``files_uploaded=0`` and empty errors (both modes).
            - Empty staging directory (exists but no files):
              no futures are submitted, returning
              ``files_uploaded=0`` with empty errors (both modes).
            - Subdirectories in staging: only regular files are
              uploaded (``is_file()`` check), directories are
              skipped.
            - Symlinks: skipped entirely (``is_symlink()`` check)
              to prevent traversal outside the staging directory.

        Args:
            node_name: Human-readable name for this node (for
                logging and result reporting).
            staging_dir: Absolute local path to the staging
                directory on this node.
            upload_dest: Remote destination path (``s3://...`` or
                ``az://...``).
            s3_profile_name: Named credential profile for
                ``StorageWriter``.
            strict: When ``True``, the first file upload failure
                raises ``ArtifactDeliveryError`` instead of recording
                the error and continuing.  When ``False`` (default),
                errors are collected and returned in the result.

        Returns:

class ArtifactDelivery:
    r"""Collect staged files from distributed worker nodes and upload to a destination.

    Generic orchestrator for the three-phase artifact lifecycle:
    staging, cross-node collection, and upload.  Fully consumer-
    agnostic -- knows nothing about the nature of the files it
    moves or which subsystem produced them.  All behaviour is
    controlled exclusively by constructor parameters.

    Why this class exists
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Multiple independent subsystems write artifacts to local
    staging directories on worker nodes during a distributed
    pipeline run.  After the pipeline finishes (but before the
    compute cluster shuts down), those files must be gathered
    from every node and uploaded to a final output directory
    (local path, S3, or Azure).

    Collection and upload are deliberately **deferred to the end
    of execution** rather than performed inline during the
    pipeline run.  Moving artifacts while stages are actively
    processing would compete for network bandwidth, disk I/O,
    and CPU cycles -- directly impacting pipeline throughput and
    stage latency.  By staging files locally during the run and
    collecting them in a single batch after the pipeline
    completes, the hot path remains uncontested.

    The three-phase lifecycle is identical across subsystems -- only
    the staging subdirectory name and the upload destination path
    differ.  Rather than duplicating the same env-var management,
    collection, upload loop, idempotency guard, and crash-safe
    cleanup in every subsystem, this class provides a single
    implementation parameterised by ``kind`` and ``upload_subdir``.

    Design decisions
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - **Factory pattern** (:meth:`create`): consumers call
      ``create()`` instead of ``__init__`` because the factory
      handles env-var setup and optional pre-shutdown hook
      registration -- side effects that a constructor should not
      perform.
    - **``collect_on_shutdown`` parameter**: controls whether
      :meth:`collect` is registered as a pre-shutdown hook
      (default) or left to the consumer to call explicitly.
      This enables on-demand collection when the consumer needs
      to control timing (e.g. collect between pipeline phases).
    - **Local vs remote routing**: :meth:`collect` constructs a
      ``StorageWriter`` and checks ``writer.is_remote`` to pick
      the optimal collection strategy.  For remote destinations,
      each worker uploads directly (``_NodeUploader`` actors),
      avoiding a driver-hop that would double network transfer.
      For local destinations, ``RayFileTransport`` gathers files
      to the driver first.  The ``StorageWriter`` abstraction is
      the single decision point -- ``ArtifactDelivery`` never
      inspects path prefixes directly.

              +-- return file count

    Parameters
    ----------
    Behaviour is controlled without any subsystem knowledge:

    - ``kind`` -- names the staging subdirectory under the shared
      base (e.g. ``"profiling"``, ``"traces"``).  Each kind is
      isolated so different subsystems never mix files.
    - ``upload_subdir`` -- optional path appended to ``output_dir``
      when uploading.  Empty string means upload directly to
      ``output_dir``; ``"traces"`` means upload to
      ``<output_dir>/traces/``.
    - ``collect_on_shutdown`` -- when ``True`` (default),
      :meth:`collect` is registered as a pre-shutdown hook and
      fires automatically.  When ``False``, the consumer calls
      :meth:`collect` explicitly.
    - ``strict`` -- when ``True``, any failure (per-file upload,
      node collection, or transport) raises
      ``ArtifactDeliveryError`` instead of logging and continuing.
      When ``False`` (default), failures are logged as warnings
      and partial delivery proceeds.

    Guarantees
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    - **Idempotent**: the ``_collected`` flag prevents double-
      execution if both the pre-shutdown hook and an explicit call
      fire.
    - **Crash-safe**: on failure, the local collection directory
      is preserved on disk and its path is logged so operators can
      manually retry the upload.  On success, only the kind-specific
      subdirectory (``<base>/<kind>/``) is removed -- the shared
      base staging directory is left intact so sibling deliveries
      can still collect their artifacts.
    - **Partial-failure tolerant** (``strict=False``): nodes that
      fail to deliver files are logged as warnings; collection
      continues for the remaining nodes.
    - **Fail-fast** (``strict=True``): the first failure raises
      ``ArtifactDeliveryError`` so the caller can abort early
      and handle the error (e.g. retry, alert, fail the job).

    Edge cases
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    - **Empty output_dir**: :meth:`collect` returns ``0``
      immediately -- no actors are deployed.
    - **Empty staging on all nodes**: returns ``0`` with an
      informational log message.
    - **Mixed success/failure across nodes**: successful nodes
      have their files uploaded; failed nodes are logged as
      warnings.  The caller receives the total uploaded count.
    - **Double call**: second call is a no-op returning ``0``.

        - **Remote** (``writer.is_remote``): deploys a

          crosses the cluster network -- only metadata returns to

        Design decisions:
            - ``StorageWriter.is_remote`` is the single routing
              decision point.  ``ArtifactDelivery`` never inspects
              path prefixes (``s3://``, ``az://``) directly -- it
              delegates that knowledge to ``StorageWriter``.
            - For remote destinations, uploading from each node
              avoids doubling network transfer (worker->driver +
              driver->S3).  The driver only coordinates actors and
              aggregates results.
            - For local destinations, ``RayFileTransport`` is
              required because worker nodes may not share a
              filesystem with the driver.

        **Idempotent**: the ``_collected`` flag prevents double-
        execution if both the pre-shutdown hook and an explicit call
        fire.

        **Crash-safe**: on failure, the local collection directory
        is preserved on disk and its path is logged so operators can
        manually retry the upload.

        **Partial-failure tolerant** (``strict=False``): nodes that
        fail to deliver files are logged as warnings; collection
        proceeds for the remaining nodes so no data is unnecessarily
        lost.

        **Fail-fast** (``strict=True``): the first failure raises
        ``ArtifactDeliveryError`` so the caller can abort early.
        The exception chain preserves the original error for
        inspection.

        Tracing (graceful degradation):
            This method is instrumented with ``traced_span``.  When
            ``collect()`` fires as a pre-shutdown hook, the OTel
            TracerProvider on the driver is still alive, so spans
            are created normally.  However, the span file is written
            to ``<staging>/traces/`` **after** the trace-collection
            hook has already gathered those files (LIFO ordering).
            As a result, spans from shutdown-triggered collection
            are best-effort -- they are fully captured when
            ``collect_on_shutdown=False`` and the consumer calls
            ``collect()`` explicitly during normal execution.

        Returns:
            Total number of files collected and uploaded.
            Returns ``0`` if already collected, no output_dir is
            configured, or no files were staged.

        Raises:
            ArtifactDeliveryError: When ``strict=True`` and any
                file upload, node collection, or transport failure
                occurs.  The ``__cause__`` attribute holds the
                original exception.

        Design decisions:
            - Direct-to-destination: the transport's
              ``_process_chunk`` already creates parent directories
              and writes file data to ``output_dir``.  For a local
              destination this is the same work that
              ``StorageWriter._resolve_local`` would do, so an
              intermediate temp dir followed by a read-back +
              rewrite loop would double the disk I/O for no benefit.
            - No cleanup step: since files land at the final
              destination, there is no temp directory to remove on
              success or preserve on failure.  On partial failure
              the destination itself contains whatever files were
              delivered, which is inspectable by operators.

        Error handling:
            Controlled by ``self._strict``:

            - ``strict=False`` (default): the entire try block is
              wrapped in a broad ``except Exception`` because
              collection runs during cluster shutdown and must
              never crash the shutdown sequence.  On failure:

              1. The exception is recorded on the current
                 ``TracedSpan`` (if tracing is active).
              2. Partially delivered files remain at the
                 destination for operator inspection.
              3. The destination path is logged at WARNING level.

            - ``strict=True``: any failure (node collection failure,
              transport error) raises ``ArtifactDeliveryError``
              with the original exception chained as ``__cause__``.

        Edge cases:
            - ``RayFileTransport.collect()`` raises: partially
              delivered files remain at the destination.  The
              exception is handled per the strict/lenient policy.
            - Zero files across all nodes: returns ``0`` early
              via the ``total_files == 0`` guard.
            - Strict + node failure: ``ArtifactDeliveryError``
              raised before the count is returned.

        Args:
            tag: Log prefix (e.g. ``"[ArtifactDelivery:profiling]"``).
            writer: Pre-constructed ``StorageWriter`` whose
                ``base_path`` is used as the output directory.

        Returns:
            Number of files delivered.  Returns ``0`` on failure
            (lenient mode only).

        Raises:

        """Upload staged files directly from each worker node to a remote destination.

        Used when the destination is remote (S3 / Azure).  Deploys
        a ``_NodeUploader`` actor on each node via
        ``NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy``.  Each actor reads files
        from the local staging directory and uploads directly to the
        remote destination via its own ``StorageWriter`` instance.

        No file data crosses the cluster network -- only metadata
        (upload counts, error messages) returns to the driver.

        Design decisions:
            - Direct upload avoids the driver-hop that
              ``_collect_local`` performs, eliminating the doubled
              network transfer (worker->driver + driver->S3).
            - Each actor creates its own ``StorageWriter`` on the
              worker node so credentials and client state are
              local to each process.
            - ``num_cpus=0`` on actors: upload is I/O-bound, so
              zero CPU reservation avoids displacing pipeline
              actors.

        Concurrency model:
            All actors upload concurrently (true parallelism).
            The driver uses adaptive ``ray.wait()`` with a short
            100 ms timeout to drain results in batches, providing
            **per-node error isolation**: a single node failure
            does not discard results from successful nodes
            (lenient mode).

            1. Each actor uploads directly to S3/Azure -- there is
               no driver bottleneck to interleave around.
            2. The driver only receives lightweight
               ``_NodeUploadResult`` metadata, not file bytes.
            3. ``ray.wait()`` returns results in completion order;
               total time = slowest successful node.

        Cleanup guarantees:
            The ``finally`` block kills all deployed actors
            regardless of success or failure, freeing Ray
            resources.  Unlike ``_collect_local``, there is no
            temp directory to preserve -- files either made it to
            S3/Azure or they didn't, and the staging directory on
            each node still contains the originals.  This holds
            in both strict and lenient modes.

        Edge cases:
            - No live nodes: returns ``0`` immediately without
              deploying any actors (both modes).
            - Node with empty staging: actor returns immediately
              with ``files_uploaded=0`` (both modes).
            - Individual file failure on a node (``strict=False``):
              recorded in the node's error list; remaining files on
              that node still upload.
            - Individual file failure on a node (``strict=True``):
              actor raises ``ArtifactDeliveryError``, which
              propagates through ``ray.get()`` as a
              ``RayTaskError``.  The driver re-raises as
              ``ArtifactDeliveryError`` immediately.
            - Single node actor crash (``strict=False``): the
              failure is recorded per-node via ``nodes_failed``;
              results from other successful nodes are preserved
              and counted toward ``total_uploaded``.
            - Single node actor crash (``strict=True``):
              ``ArtifactDeliveryError`` raised immediately;
              results from already-completed nodes are discarded.
            - Timeout: the adaptive ``ray.wait()`` loop uses a short
              100 ms timeout per call.  If no node produces a
              result for ``_REMOTE_COLLECT_TIMEOUT_S`` cumulative
              seconds (default 600 s), all remaining nodes are
              marked as failed (lenient) or
              ``ArtifactDeliveryError`` is raised (strict).
              Staging directories on nodes are preserved for
