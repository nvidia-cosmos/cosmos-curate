"""Cross-node file transport using Ray streaming generators.

Collects files from a local staging directory on each Ray node and
delivers them to a central output directory on the driver.  Designed
for crash-safe artifact delivery: workers write to a local staging
directory during execution, and this module gathers those files
**post-pipeline** so that artifacts survive even if workers are
killed (SIGKILL) during the run.

This is a **generic** transport -- not coupled to profiling, tracing,
or any specific subsystem.  Any code that needs to move files from
Ray worker nodes to the driver can use :class:`RayFileTransport`.

Design rationale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module follows Ray best practices documented in the Ray core
patterns and tips guides:

* **ray.wait() pipeline processing** (Ray docs "Tip 4: Pipeline data
  processing") -- chunks from all nodes are processed as they arrive
  via ``ray.wait(num_returns=len(pending), timeout=0.1)``, so total
  collection time equals the slowest node, not the sum of all nodes.
  The short timeout drains all refs ready within 100 ms per call,
  reducing gRPC round-trips on large clusters (1000+ nodes) from
  O(total_chunks) to O(total_chunks / batch_size).

* **Limit-pending-tasks pattern** (Ray docs "Pattern: Using ray.wait
  to limit the number of pending tasks") -- the adaptive
  ``ray.wait()`` combined with immediate process-and-discard keeps
  the pending set bounded and prevents unbounded memory growth on the
  driver.

* **Delayed ray.get()** (Ray docs "Tip 1: Delay ray.get()") -- we
  only call ``ray.get(ref)`` after ``ray.wait()`` confirms the ref is
  ready, never eagerly.  This ensures the driver never blocks waiting
  for a single node while another node has data available.

* **Double-layer backpressure** -- two independent mechanisms work
  together to bound memory:

  1. **Generator-level** (worker side):
     ``_generator_backpressure_num_objects`` limits how many
     ``ObjectRef``s each worker can have in flight.  With value=2,
     the worker pauses its generator after yielding 2 unconsumed
     refs.

  2. **Driver-level** (driver side): ``ray.wait()`` with a short
     timeout processes chunks in adaptive batches.  After writing
     each chunk to disk, the ``_FileChunk`` becomes
     garbage-collectable immediately.

  Combined per-node in-flight: 1 ref in the pending dict (being
  waited on) + 1 ref buffered in the generator (pre-fetched) = 2.
  Peak driver memory = ``chunk_bytes`` (one chunk being written).

* **Why NOT ray.util.as_completed()** -- ``as_completed()`` operates
  on a fixed list of ``ObjectRef``s.  Our streaming generators produce
  refs incrementally: after processing one chunk, we call
  ``next(gen)`` to advance the generator and obtain the next ref.
  This dynamic ref-generation pattern is incompatible with
  ``as_completed()``.  The custom ``ray.wait()`` loop handles it
  naturally.

* **Adaptive short-timeout batching** -- on large clusters (1000+
  nodes), ``ray.wait(num_returns=1)`` causes O(total_chunks) gRPC
  round-trips, each passing the full pending-refs list.  Instead,
  ``ray.wait(num_returns=len(pending), timeout=0.1)`` drains all
  refs ready within 100 ms in a single call.  A cumulative stall
  guard (``timeout_s``) replaces the per-call timeout to detect
  genuine no-progress situations.  On small clusters, few refs
  arrive per 100 ms window, so behaviour is equivalent to
  ``num_returns=1`` with negligible latency overhead.

* ``NodeAffinitySchedulingStrategy`` for node pinning (codebase
  convention), not ``STRICT_SPREAD`` placement groups.

* ``num_cpus=0`` on ``_NodeCollector`` -- the actor does file I/O
  only, not compute.  Zero CPU reservation avoids starving pipeline
  actors of compute resources.

* Per-node error isolation -- one node timing out or raising does not
  abort collection from other nodes.

* Explicit actor cleanup via ``ray.kill()`` in a ``finally`` block.

* No cluster lifecycle management -- the caller owns Ray.

Concurrency model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Worker-side file reading is **truly parallel** -- each
``_NodeCollector`` is a separate Ray actor process on a separate
machine.  All actors execute their ``stream_files()`` generators
simultaneously.  The driver consumes chunks **single-threaded but
interleaved** across all nodes via ``ray.wait()``.

Two levels of concurrency work together:

1. **Workers (parallel)**: each actor reads files from its local
   disk and yields ``_FileChunk`` objects into the Ray object store.
   All actors run concurrently -- node A yields chunks while node B
   yields chunks while node C yields chunks.

2. **Driver (single-threaded, interleaved)**: the ``collect()``
   method calls ``ray.wait(list(pending), num_returns=len(pending),
   timeout=0.1)`` which returns all refs ready within 100 ms.
   Whichever node's chunks arrive first get processed first.  The
   driver never waits for node A to finish before touching node B.

    Total time = max(node_A_time, node_B_time, node_C_time)
    NOT           node_A_time + node_B_time + node_C_time

Why ``ray.get()`` is safe here
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A naive ``ray.get(ref)`` blocks until the object is resolved --
dangerous if node A is slow while node B has data ready:

::

    # BAD -- blocks on A even if B is ready
    chunk_a = ray.get(ref_a)  # waits 10s
    chunk_b = ray.get(ref_b)  # B was ready instantly, wasted 10s

This module avoids that pitfall by always calling ``ray.wait()``
first, then ``ray.get()`` only on refs confirmed as ready:

::

    # GOOD -- only ray.get() refs that are already resolved
    ready, _ = ray.wait([ref_a, ref_b, ref_c], num_returns=1)
    # ready = [ref_b]  (B resolved first)
    chunk = ray.get(ref_b)  # instant -- data already in object store

The subsequent ``ray.get()`` is essentially free -- it just
deserialises bytes from the object store into the driver's Python
heap.  No network wait occurs because the object is already local.

    writing to the correct file handle.

    The ``gen`` field holds a Ray ``StreamingObjectRefGenerator``
    (returned by ``actor.stream_files.options(...).remote(...)``).
    It is typed as ``object`` because Ray does not expose a public
    type for streaming generators.  Advancing with ``next(gen)``
    returns the next ``ObjectRef`` quickly (ref creation is
    near-instant on the driver; blocking happens only at
    ``ray.get()``).

class RayFileTransport:
    """Generic cross-node file transport using Ray streaming generators.

    Collects files from a local staging directory on each Ray node
    and delivers them to a central output directory on the driver.
    Fully decoupled from any specific subsystem -- usable for
    profiling artifacts, traces, pipeline outputs, or any other
    files that workers produce during execution.

    This transport does NOT manage the Ray cluster lifecycle -- the
    caller must ensure Ray is initialized before calling ``collect()``
    and keeps it alive until collection completes.

    Files are transferred using Ray's streaming generator protocol
    with per-file chunking and double-layer backpressure (see module
    docstring).  Peak memory on the driver is bounded to
    ``chunk_bytes`` (default 128 MB) per active node, regardless of
    total staging directory size or individual file size.

    Collection uses ``ray.wait()`` to consume chunks from all nodes
    in parallel: whichever node has data ready first gets processed
    first.  Total collection time equals the slowest node, not the
    sum of all nodes (Ray docs "Tip 4: Pipeline data processing").

            State transitions for a 400 MB file (chunk_bytes=128 MB):

        Design decision: we detect new files by comparing
        ``chunk.arcname`` against ``state.current_arcname`` rather
        than relying on a separate "start-of-file" flag.  This
        keeps the ``_FileChunk`` protocol minimal (3 fields) and
        avoids an additional coordination state between worker and
        driver.

        Edge cases:
            - Back-to-back small files: each has ``is_last=True``,
              so the handle opens and closes on every chunk.
            - Worker yields chunks for a new file without sending
              ``is_last=True`` for the previous file (should not
              happen): the old handle is closed when the arcname
              changes, so no file descriptor leak occurs.
            - ``open()`` failure (disk full, permissions): the old
              handle is already closed and cleared to ``None``
              before the ``open()`` attempt.  The exception
              propagates to ``_consume_ready_ref``, which calls
              ``_finalize_node`` -- seeing ``None``, it does
              nothing.  No double-close, no fd leak, no silent
              suppression.
            - ``close()`` failure on ``is_last`` (NFS flush error):
              ``try/finally`` guarantees the state machine resets
              (``handle=None``, ``arcname=""``, count incremented)
              even if ``close()`` raises.  The exception still
              propagates -- it is NOT suppressed.

           non-blocking and triggers actor placement + generator
           startup concurrently across all nodes.
        2. **Pass 2 -- drain ``next(gen)``**: pull the first
           ``ObjectRef`` from each generator.  By this point, most
           actors have already been placed and started executing,
           so ``next(gen)`` returns quickly.

        On a 1000-node cluster, the single-pass approach (interleaved

        placement didn't start until node N-1's first chunk was

        Deploys one ``_NodeCollector`` actor per alive node, starts
        all streaming generators simultaneously, then enters a
        ``ray.wait()`` loop that processes chunks from whichever
        node has data ready first.

        The ``ray.wait()`` loop implements the "Pipeline data
        processing" pattern from the Ray documentation: instead of
        waiting for all chunks from node A before starting node B,
        chunks are processed in readiness order.  This means total
        collection time equals the slowest node, not the sum of all
        nodes.

        After processing each chunk, ``next(gen)`` advances that
        node's streaming generator to obtain the next ``ObjectRef``.
        ``next(gen)`` returns quickly because ObjectRef creation is
        near-instant on the driver -- blocking only happens at
        ``ray.get()`` when the value is needed.  When a generator
        is exhausted (``StopIteration``), the node is finalized
        and recorded as successful.

        Timeout semantics: ``timeout_s`` is the cumulative stall
        guard.  The ``ray.wait()`` loop uses a short 100 ms timeout
        per call (adaptive batching).  If no chunk from ANY node
        arrives for ``timeout_s`` cumulative seconds, all remaining
        nodes are marked as failed and the loop exits.

        Error isolation: when ``strict=False``, an exception from
        one node removes only that node from the pending dict and
        records the failure.  Other nodes continue streaming.

        All actors are killed in a ``finally`` block regardless of
        success or failure.

        Concurrency model:
            Worker-side file reading is **truly parallel** -- each
            ``_NodeCollector`` is a separate Ray actor process on a
            separate machine, and all actors execute their
            ``stream_files()`` generators simultaneously.

            The driver (this method) processes chunks
            **single-threaded but interleaved** across all nodes.
            ``ray.wait(list(pending), num_returns=len(pending),
            timeout=0.1)`` returns all refs ready within 100 ms,
            so whichever node's chunks arrive first get processed
            first.  The driver never waits for node A to finish
            before touching node B.

            ``ray.get()`` safety: this method **never** calls
            ``ray.get()`` eagerly.  It always calls ``ray.wait()``
            first, which returns only refs whose data is already in
            the object store.  The subsequent ``ray.get()`` is
            essentially free (deserialise from local object store,
            no network wait).  This is the "Delayed ray.get()"
            pattern from Ray docs (Tip 1).

        Cleanup guarantees:
            The ``finally`` block runs two passes in order:

            1. **Close local file handles first** -- any
               partially-written file is flushed to disk so it
               can be inspected for debugging.  This must happen
               before actor teardown because killing the actor
               could invalidate in-flight data.
            2. **Kill remote actors second** -- releases Ray
               resources (CPU, object store memory) regardless
               of how collection ended (success, timeout,
               exception, or KeyboardInterrupt).

        Preconditions:
            - Ray must be initialized (``ray.init()`` called).
            - The cluster must remain alive until this method
              returns.  Shutting down Ray mid-collection causes
              undefined behaviour.
            - ``staging_dir`` must be the same absolute path on
              every node.

        Args:
            staging_dir: Path to the staging directory on each node.
                Must be the same path on every node (e.g. set via
                an environment variable before the pipeline starts).
            output_dir: Local directory on the driver where collected
                files are written.  Created if it does not exist.
                Files from all nodes are merged into a flat structure
                (artifact names include hostname+PID so collisions
                are not expected).
            timeout_s: Cumulative stall guard timeout.  If no chunk
                from any node arrives for this many cumulative
                seconds (measured in ``_WAIT_BATCH_TIMEOUT_S``
                increments), remaining nodes are marked as failed.
                Defaults to 600 seconds.
            strict: Error handling policy.  When ``False`` (default),
                node failures are logged as warnings and recorded in
                the result.  When ``True``, any error (timeout,
                exception, no alive nodes) is raised to the caller.
            chunk_bytes: Maximum bytes per streamed chunk.  Files
                smaller than this are transferred in one piece.
                Larger files are split into sequential chunks of
                this size.  Defaults to 128 MB.

        Returns:
            A :class:`CollectResult` with per-node outcomes.

        Separated from :meth:`collect` to keep the public method

        viewers can see deploy/seed/consume/cleanup timing without
        per-chunk overhead.

        Tracing: not instrumented separately -- called within the
        ``RayFileTransport.collect`` parent span.

        Args:
            nodes: Alive node info dicts from ``get_live_nodes()``.
            staging_dir: Staging directory path (same on every node).
            output_dir: Local destination directory on the driver.

                ``ray.wait()`` loop uses ``_WAIT_BATCH_TIMEOUT_S``
                (100 ms) per call; ``timeout_s`` is the maximum
                cumulative time with zero results before the loop
                triggers ``_handle_timeout``.
            strict: Error handling policy.
            chunk_bytes: Maximum bytes per chunk.
            span: Active ``TracedSpan`` for attribute/event annotation.
