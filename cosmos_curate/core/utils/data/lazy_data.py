"""Self-managing lazy data wrapper for split-field pipeline transport.

Provides ``LazyData[T]``, a combined type that manages data lifecycle
across pipeline stages.  Data can live inline (in Python heap) or in
Ray Plasma (as an ObjectRef).  Custom pickle ensures that stored data
flows through pass-through stages as a 48-byte ObjectRef instead of
the full payload.

::

    LazyData state machine:

    +-------+  .store()   +--------+  .resolve()  +--------------+
    | inline | ---------> | stored | -----------> | materialized |
    +-------+             +--------+              +--------------+
        |                   |    ^                     |    |
        |  .drop()          |    +---- .release() -----+    |
        v                   v                               v
    +-------+           +-------+                       +-------+
    | empty |           | empty |                       | empty |
    +-------+           +-------+                       +-------+

    Pickle behavior by state:

        inline:       value serialized via PickleBuffer (zero-copy for numpy)
        stored:       only the 48-byte ObjectRef is serialized
        materialized: only the 48-byte ObjectRef (mmap view excluded)
        empty:        both None

    Graceful fallback: if a producer forgets to call ``.store()``,
    ``__getstate__`` serializes the value inline via PickleBuffer.
    Data is never silently lost -- just not split-field optimized.

Current limitations -- split-field pattern disabled:

    The split-field optimization (``.store()`` / ``.release()``) is fully
    implemented but **disabled** across all pipeline stages.  All
    ``.store()`` and ``.release()`` calls are commented out with
    ``TODO(LazyData)`` markers.  Data always flows **inline**.

    Root cause -- ObjectRef ownership in Xenna execution modes:

    ``ray.put()`` inside an actor creates an ObjectRef **owned by that
    actor**.  When the actor process is terminated, the Plasma object
    backing the ObjectRef is garbage-collected, regardless of whether
    other processes still hold the reference.

    **Batch mode** (guaranteed failure):

    Xenna batch mode runs stages sequentially and kills each stage's
    actors (``pool.stop()``) before starting the next stage.  ObjectRefs
    created by Stage N actors are invalidated before Stage N+1 can
    resolve them.

    ::

        Batch mode -- sequential execution, actors killed between stages:

        time --->
        +--[Stage 0 actors]--+
        |  .store() creates  |     +--[Stage 1 actors]--+
        |  ObjectRef owned   |     | .resolve() calls   |
        |  by Stage 0 actor  |     | ray.get(ref)       |
        +--------------------+     +--------------------+
               |         ^              |
               |  pool   |              | OwnerDiedError!
               |  .stop()|              | ObjectRef owner is
               |  kills  |              | already dead.
               +---------+              v

        Timeline:
        |====[S0 run]====|==[S0 kill]==|====[S1 run]====|
                         ^              ^
                    pool.stop()    S1 tries ray.get()
                    kills S0       on S0-owned ref
                    actors         --> CRASH

    **Streaming mode** (race condition at tail):

    In streaming mode all stages run concurrently, so most ObjectRefs
    are resolved while the producer is still alive.  However, when a
    stage finishes its last batch, its actors are stopped while
    downstream stages may still have unresolved ObjectRefs in the
    inter-stage queue.

    ::

        Streaming mode -- concurrent execution, tail race window:

        time --->
        +--[Stage 0 actors]--+
        | .store() ok here   |
        | downstream resolves|     +--[Stage 1 actors]--+
        | while S0 is alive  |     | .resolve() works   |
        +--------------------+     | for most data...   |
              ^         |          |                    |
              |  pool   |          | last few refs in   |
              |  .stop()|          | queue[0] may fail! |
              +---------+          +--------------------+

        Timeline (safe for most data, risky at the tail):
        |=========[S0 run]=========|==[S0 kill]==|
                                     |
        |==[S1 idle]==|====[S1 run]===============|
                                     ^
                                S0 killed. S1 still has
                                items in queue[0] with
                                S0-owned ObjectRefs.

    Current workaround -- inline-only transport:

    With ``.store()`` disabled, data stays inline (value field) at every
    stage boundary.  The ``__getstate__`` fallback serializes via
    PEP 574 PickleBuffer, which is zero-copy for numpy arrays on the
    same node.  This is Phase 1 of the migration.

    ::

        What we have now (inline, no split-field):

        Stage 0          Stage 1          Stage 2
        [produce]   -->  [pass-through]   -->  [consume]
           |                  |                    |

           |                  |                    |
        serialize          serialize            serialize
        via PickleBuffer   via PickleBuffer    via PickleBuffer
        (zero-copy numpy)  (zero-copy numpy)   (zero-copy numpy)

        + numpy zero-copy via PickleBuffer (3-14x vs bytes)
        + nbytes metadata without materializing
        + unified API (resolve/store/release/drop)
        - full payload "present" at every stage boundary

        What split-field would give (when ownership is fixed):

        Stage 0          Stage 1          Stage 2
        [.store()]  -->  [pass-through]  -->  [.resolve()]
           |                  |                    |
        value=None         value=None          value=payload
        ref=48 bytes       ref=48 bytes        ref=None
           |                  |                    |
        serialize          serialize            ray.get()
        48-byte ref        48-byte ref         (zero-copy mmap)
        (trivial)          (trivial)

        + intermediate stages serialize only 48 bytes
        + only the consumer touches the actual data
        - requires producer actor to outlive downstream consumers

    Possible fixes (not yet implemented):

    1. **Driver-side ray.put()**: move the ``ray.put()`` call from the
       actor (inside ``.store()``) to the Xenna framework driver, which
       outlives all actors.  Requires framework-level changes.
    2. **Deferred actor teardown**: keep producer actors alive until all
       downstream stages have resolved their ObjectRefs.  Requires
       framework-level changes to the pool lifecycle.
    3. **Detached named objects**: use ``ray.put()`` with a detached
       owner so the object outlives the creating actor.  Adds complexity
       for naming and cleanup.

    Future candidates for LazyData migration:

    - ``Clip.extracted_frames`` -- dict of decoded numpy frames
    - ``Window.mp4_bytes`` -- raw MP4 segment bytes

    Method vocabulary:

        store()    -- push value to Plasma, clear local copy
        resolve()  -- pull from Plasma into local heap (cached)
        release()  -- drop local copy, keep Plasma ref for downstream
        drop()     -- drop everything (local copy + Plasma ref)

    Thread safety:
        NOT thread-safe.  Each actor owns its own LazyData instances.
        Concurrent access from multiple threads on the same instance
        could race on ``value`` / ``ref``.  Use external synchronization
        if shared access is needed (unlikely in the actor-per-stage model).

    Design decisions:
        - Caching after ``.resolve()``: same-node ``ray.get()`` returns
          an mmap view (very lightweight), so caching avoids repeated
          locking and ref-counting overhead without significant memory
          cost.
        - Explicit cleanup (``.release()`` / ``.drop()``): callers know
          when they are done with the data.  Automatic GC timing is
          non-deterministic.
        - Adaptive ``__getstate__``: if a producer forgets ``.store()``,
          the value is serialized inline via PickleBuffer (same as
          Phase 1 behavior).  This graceful fallback prevents data loss.
        - ``attrs.define`` default ``on_setattr`` includes
          ``attrs.setters.convert``, so converters run on every
          assignment automatically when used on data model fields.
