"""Generic OpenTelemetry span utilities for Cosmos-Curate.

This module provides the **public span API** used by application code
to create and annotate distributed traces.  It is independent of Ray
and can be imported safely from any environment.

The Ray-specific tracing hook (worker setup, file export, library
auto-instrumentation) lives in :mod:`tracing_hook`.

Setup vs Usage (two-layer design)
---------------------------------
The tracing system is split into two layers with different roles::

    +-------------------------------------------------+
    |  Stage / application code                       |  <-- YOU ARE HERE
    |  import traced_span, traced, TracedSpan          |
    |  (safe to call always, no-ops when not enabled) |
    +-------------------------------------------------+
                     |
                     | uses
                     v
    +-------------------------------------------------+
    |  tracing.py  (THIS MODULE)                      |
    |  Public span API -- no Ray, no SDK setup        |
    |  traced_span, @traced, TracedSpan.current()     |
    +-------------------------------------------------+
                     |
                     | creates spans via
                     v
    +-------------------------------------------------+
    |  opentelemetry.trace  (OTel API layer)          |
    |  get_tracer() -> start_as_current_span()        |
    |  No-op NonRecordingSpan when no provider set    |
    +-------------------------------------------------+
                     ^
                     | configures TracerProvider
                     |
    +-------------------------------------------------+
    |  tracing_hook.py  (SETUP LAYER)                 |
    |  enable_tracing() -> setup_tracing()            |
    |  Called by profiling_scope() on the driver       |
    |  Triggered by --profile-tracing CLI flag        |
    +-------------------------------------------------+

**You do NOT need to call ``enable_tracing()``.**  Each pipeline's
``main()`` wraps its execution in ``profiling_scope(args)`` --
the top-level context manager that sets up all profiling and
tracing infrastructure::

    # run_pipeline.py (pipeline entry point)
    def main() -> None:
        args = parse_args()
        with profiling_scope(args):   # <-- must be the outermost wrapper
            args.func(args)           #     everything runs inside this

``profiling_scope()`` reads CLI flags (``--profile-tracing``,
``--profile-cpu``, etc.) and configures everything automatically.
Stage code just imports and uses the public API -- no setup calls
needed:

- **``--profile-tracing`` passed**: spans are recorded and exported
  to files and/or an OTLP collector.
- **``--profile-tracing`` NOT passed**: all span API calls become
  zero-cost no-ops (OTel creates ``NonRecordingSpan`` objects).
  No overhead, no errors.

No ``if tracing_enabled`` guards are needed in your code.

Choosing the right API
----------------------
Three forms are available.  Use the decision tree below::

    "I need tracing in my code"
              |
              v
    Is the span a WHOLE function/method body?
              |                    |
              v (yes)              v (no, or partial)
        @traced(name)        traced_span(name)
        (decorator)          (context manager)
              |                    |
              v                    v
    Do I also need to annotate a PARENT span
    created by the framework (e.g. _ProfiledStage)?
              |
              v (yes)
        TracedSpan.current()
        (wraps existing span, NO new span created)

Decision rules:

1. **``@traced(name)``** -- use when the **entire** function body
   is one logical span.  Attributes are fixed at decoration time.
   Cleanest syntax, no indentation.

2. **``traced_span(name)``** -- use when you need a span around a
   **subset** of a function, or when you need to set attributes
   **dynamically** based on values computed during execution.
   Returns a ``TracedSpan`` via ``with ... as span:``.

3. **``TracedSpan.current()``** -- use when you want to annotate a
   span that **already exists** higher up the call stack (e.g. the
   lifecycle span from ``_ProfiledStage``).  Does NOT create a new
   span -- just wraps the active one.

All three are **safe to call always**, even when tracing is not
enabled.  No ``if`` guards are needed.

Public API
----------
:class:`TracedSpan`
    Lightweight wrapper around an OTel ``Span`` with Null Object
    semantics -- all methods are no-ops when the underlying span is
    ``None``.

:func:`traced_span`
    Context manager creating a child span under the current active
    span.  Yields a :class:`TracedSpan`.

:func:`traced`
    Decorator wrapping a function body in an OTel span.

``TracedSpan.current()``
    Class method returning a :class:`TracedSpan` wrapping the
    current active span (for annotating spans created higher up).

``StatusCode``
    Re-exported from ``opentelemetry.trace`` for convenience
    (``UNSET``, ``OK``, ``ERROR``).

Helper functions
----------------
:func:`short_hostname`
    Cached short hostname (everything before the first dot).

:func:`process_tag`
    ``<hostname>_<pid>`` tag for unique artifact file names.

Span hierarchy example
----------------------
When tracing is enabled (``--profile-tracing``), three levels of
spans are produced automatically.  Application code can add custom
child spans at any level::

    [Ray: actor_method process_data]              <-- automatic (Ray hook)
      +-- [cosmos_curate: MyStage.process_data]      <-- _ProfiledStage
           | attrs: stage.name, stage.num_input_tasks,
           |        profiling.artifact_id
           +-- [cosmos_curate: MyStage.download]     <-- your traced_span
           |   attrs: download.url, download.bytes
           +-- [cosmos_curate: MyStage.sample]       <-- StageTimer
           |   attrs: stage.name, stage.num_samples
           +-- [cosmos_curate: MyStage.sample]
           ...

Quick-start example
-------------------
Spans should be created at the **batch** or **phase** level, not
per-item.  At scale (100 M+ items), per-item spans generate
excessive trace data.  Record per-item details as aggregated
attributes on the batch span instead::

    from cosmos_curate.core.utils.infra.tracing import (
        TracedSpan, traced, traced_span, StatusCode,
    )

    class MyStage(CuratorStage):

        @traced("MyStage.setup_model")           # <-- whole method
        def _load_model(self):
            self._model = load_weights()

        def process_data(self, tasks):
            # Batch-level span -- one span per process_data call,
            # NOT one per item:
            with traced_span("MyStage.infer",
                             attributes={"stage.input_count": len(tasks)}) as span:
                results = [self._model(t.data) for t in tasks]
                span.set_attribute("stage.output_count", len(results))

            # Annotate the parent span (no new span created):
            TracedSpan.current().set_attribute("stage.total", len(tasks))
            return tasks

class TracedSpan:
    """Lightweight wrapper around an OpenTelemetry span.

    Uses the Null Object pattern: all methods silently return
    without error when the underlying ``_span`` is ``None``.

    There are two ways to obtain a ``TracedSpan``:

    1. **Create a new child span** via the :func:`traced_span` context
       manager (preferred for scoped work)::

           with traced_span("MyStage.download", attributes={"url": url}) as span:
               span.set_attribute("bytes", len(data))
               download(url)

    2. **Wrap the current active span** via :meth:`current` (useful
       when you want to annotate a span created higher up the call
       stack, e.g. by ``_ProfiledStage``)::

           TracedSpan.current().set_attributes({
               "stage.rss_after_mb": rss_after,
           })

    Note: unhandled exceptions that propagate out of a
    :func:`traced_span` block are automatically recorded by OTel
    (``record_exception=True`` is the default for
    ``start_as_current_span``).  The manual methods are for
    *caught* exceptions that should still be visible in traces.

    directly.  Use :func:`traced_span` or :func:`traced` instead.

    The anchor is created with **no parent** (explicit empty context),
    making it the true root of the trace.  It is ended immediately so
    backends (Jaeger, Tempo, etc.) receive it **before** any child
    spans arrive -- eliminating "invalid parent span ID" warnings
    that occur when a long-lived root arrives last.

    Even though the span is ended, its context (trace_id + span_id)
    stays attached as the current OTel context for the duration of
    the ``with`` block.  All spans created inside this block inherit
    the anchor's trace_id and use its span_id as their parent.

    Preconditions:
        - ``enable_tracing()`` MUST have been called before this
          function, so a real ``TracerProvider`` is active.
        - ``propagate_trace_context()`` should be called inside
          the ``with`` block to share the anchor's trace context
          with worker processes via environment variable.

        +-- tracer.start_span(name, context=EMPTY)
        |     Creates TRUE root span (no parent inherited)

        |        state.scope("main")       <-- child of anchor
        |
        +-- detach anchor context (finally)

    Typical usage in ``profiling_scope()``::

        with trace_root_anchor("pipeline.trace_anchor"):
            propagate_trace_context()   # workers inherit anchor IDs
            with state.scope("main"):   # _root.main is child of anchor
                yield                   # pipeline runs

    Resulting trace hierarchy::

        trace_anchor  (root, no parent, ends FIRST)
          +-- _root.main              (ends LAST, parent=anchor)
          +-- stage spans             (parent=anchor via env var)

    Args:
        name: Span name for the anchor (e.g. ``"pipeline.trace_anchor"``).
        attributes: Optional key-value pairs attached to the span.

    Yields:
        A :class:`TracedSpan` wrapping the (already ended) anchor span.

    """Wrap a function in an OTel span (decorator form).

    **When to use**: when the **entire** function body is one logical
    span and attributes are known at decoration time (static).  For
    partial-function spans or dynamic attributes, prefer
    :func:`traced_span` (context manager).

    Equivalent to wrapping the function body in
    ``with traced_span(name, attributes=...):``.  The span name and
    attributes are fixed at decoration time.

    Uses ``wrapt.decorator`` for robust signature preservation
    across plain functions, bound methods, class methods, and
    static methods.

    Unhandled exceptions are automatically recorded on the span by
    OTel (``record_exception=True`` is the default).

    ::

        @traced("MyModel.predict", attributes={"model": "resnet50"})
        def predict(self, batch):
            ...

        Calling predict(batch) internally does:

        traced_span("MyModel.predict", attributes={"model": "resnet50"})
              |
              +-- span starts (child of current active span)
              +-- predict() body executes
              +-- span ends (duration = function wall-clock time)
              +-- exception? -> auto-recorded on span by OTel

    Works with both sync and async functions.  For ``async def``
    targets, the span stays open for the full coroutine execution
    (not just until the coroutine object is returned).

    Trace volume is controlled by OTel's ``ParentBasedTraceIdRatio``
    sampler (configured via ``--profile-tracing-sampling``), which
    makes the sampling decision at the root span and propagates it
    to all descendants.

    Usage::

        from cosmos_curate.core.utils.infra.tracing import traced

        @traced("MyModel.predict", attributes={"model": "resnet50"})
        def predict(self, batch: list[Frame]) -> list[float]:
            return self._model(batch)

        @traced("MyStage.generate")
        async def generate(self, prompt: str) -> str:
            return await self._engine.generate(prompt)

    This is equivalent to::

        def predict(self, batch: list[Frame]) -> list[float]:
            with traced_span("MyModel.predict", attributes={"model": "resnet50"}):
                return self._model(batch)

    Args:
        name: Span name -- typically ``"ClassName.method"``.
        attributes: Optional static key-value pairs attached to
            every invocation's span.  For dynamic attributes that
            depend on runtime values, use :func:`traced_span`
            instead and call ``span.set_attribute()`` inside the
            ``with`` block.

    Returns:
        A decorator that wraps the target function.
