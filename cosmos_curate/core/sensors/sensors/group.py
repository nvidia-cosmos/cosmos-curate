    ``SensorGroup`` owns a named collection of sensors, exposes aggregate
    ``start_ns`` / ``end_ns`` bounds, and drives all sensor generators in
    lockstep through a single ``.sample(spec)`` entry point.

    Partial coverage:
        When a sensor has no data for a window it yields empty
        ``SensorData`` (``len(align_timestamps_ns) == 0``). Such sensors are
        omitted from that window's ``AlignedFrame.sensor_data``.  Windows
        where *every* sensor has no data produce an ``AlignedFrame`` with an
        empty ``sensor_data`` mapping.

    Policy enforcement:
        The same ``spec`` — including ``spec.policy`` — is passed to every
        sensor generator.  Each sensor enforces the tolerance independently
        via :func:`~cosmos_curate.core.sensors.sampling.sampler.sample_window_indices`.
        A ``ValueError`` raised by any sensor propagates to the caller
        unchanged.
