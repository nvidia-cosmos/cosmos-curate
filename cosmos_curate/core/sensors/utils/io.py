    """Convert *src* to a readable or writable file-like object.

    Return type is :class:`~typing.BinaryIO` or :class:`~smart_open.utils.FileLikeProxy`.
    All current return paths are compatible with ``with`` statements, so callers
    may use ``with open_file(...) as stream: ...`` when they own the returned
    handle and want it closed promptly.

    If *src* is an Azure or S3 URI, pass *client_params* for the client.

    If *src* is already a caller-owned buffered binary stream, this function returns it
    unchanged. Callers that use ``with`` and need borrow-only semantics should
    use :func:`open_data_source` instead. In general, prefer
    :func:`open_data_source` when ownership or automatic cleanup semantics matter.

    Arguments:
        src: Local path, URI, raw bytes, or an existing buffered binary stream.
        mode: File open mode (default ``"rb"``).  Use ``"wb"`` for binary writes.
            Must be a read or write mode (e.g. ``"rb"``, ``"wb"``).
        client_params: Extra arguments for ``smart_open`` when *src* is a cloud URI.

    Returns:
        A BinaryIO or FileLikeProxy object. Callers are responsible for closing
        the returned handle when appropriate.
