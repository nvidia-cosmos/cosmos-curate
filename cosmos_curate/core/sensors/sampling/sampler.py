    Window-local semantics
    ----------------------
    This function treats ``grid`` as one sampling window emitted by
    :class:`~cosmos_curate.core.sensors.sampling.grid.SamplingGrid`.

    - ``window.timestamps_ns`` are the reference timestamps that belong to the current
      half-open window.
    - ``window.exclusive_end_ns`` is the exclusive right boundary marker.
    - Eligible canonical timestamps are restricted to the same half-open
      interval ``[window.timestamps_ns[0], window.exclusive_end_ns)``.

    In other words, this function performs nearest-neighbour matching only
    within the current window. Canonical timestamps outside the window are
    ignored, even if one of them would be closer in absolute time to a
    reference timestamp in ``window.timestamps_ns``.

    Return value semantics
    ----------------------
    The returned ``indices`` always refer to the original ``canonical`` array
    passed by the caller, not to an internal filtered sub-array. This allows
    callers to reuse the indices to look up aligned sidecar arrays such as
    ``pts_stream`` or frame payloads that are stored in parallel with
    ``canonical``.

    Args:
        canonical: Full canonical timestamp timeline for one sensor. Must be
            strictly increasing.
        window: One strictly increasing sampling window. window.exclusive_end_ns
            is an exclusive right boundary marker and is not sampled.
        policy: Optional sampling policy. When provided, each matched canonical
            timestamp must be within ``policy.tolerance_ns`` of its reference
            grid timestamp.
        dedup: Whether to deduplicate repeated canonical picks. When True,
            repeated matches are collapsed and ``counts[i]`` records how many
            reference timestamps mapped to ``canonical[indices[i]]``.

    Returns:
        Tuple ``(indices, counts)``.

        - ``indices`` are indices into the original ``canonical`` array.
        - ``counts`` records multiplicity for each returned canonical index.

        If there are no eligible canonical timestamps in the current window,
        returns two empty ``int64`` arrays.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``canonical`` is empty.
        ValueError: If ``canonical`` is not strictly increasing.
        ValueError: If ``window.timestamps_ns`` is not strictly increasing.
        ValueError: If ``policy`` is provided and any matched canonical
            timestamp exceeds ``policy.tolerance_ns`` from its reference
            timestamp.
