# Cosmos-Curate Curator Docs

This directory collects documentation for the curator pipeline layer. It is organized by the dominant purpose of each document:

- **Guides** teach workflows and debugging tasks.
- **Reference** documents current behavior, APIs, output formats, and operational contracts.
- **Design** captures architecture direction, rationale, plans, and open questions.

## Guides

- [Pipeline Design Guide](guides/PIPELINE_DESIGN.md) - build or modify curator pipelines.
- [Stage Replay Guide](guides/STAGE_REPLAY.md) - debug stages in isolation.
- [Interactive Slurm Development Guide](guides/SLURM_INTERACTIVE.md) - iterate from an interactive Slurm allocation.
- [Profiling Guide](guides/PROFILING.md) - collect and inspect CPU and memory profiles.
- [Observability Guide](guides/OBSERVABILITY.md) - monitor pipeline health and metrics.
- [vLLM Async Captioning Guide](guides/VLLM_ASYNC_CAPTIONING.md) - use the async vLLM captioning path.
- [vLLM Interface Plugin Guide](guides/VLLM_INTERFACE_PLUGIN.md) - add a new vLLM model plugin.
