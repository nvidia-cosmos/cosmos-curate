# Responsible Use of AI Models

While this project does **not host or distribute AI models directly**, it may support or enable the use of third-party AI models. Users are solely responsible for downloading, using, and deploying any external models in a safe, ethical, and secure manner. More specifically, AI models generate responses and outputs based on complex algorithms and machine learning techniques, and those responses or outputs may be inaccurate or offensive. By downloading a model, you assume the risk of any harm caused by any response or output of the model. By using this software or model, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of the license, acceptable use policy and Whisper's privacy policy. Please refer to the respective [model cards](./MODEL_CARDS.md) for details about the models referred to in this project.

## Guidelines for Responsible Use

- ⚠️ **Do not use models to process personal, sensitive, or confidential data.**
- 🧠 Be aware of and mitigate potential biases or harmful outputs in model results.
- 🔒 Follow best practices for security when handling models, inputs, and outputs.
- 📜 Ensure compliance with all relevant laws, licenses, and third-party terms of service.

## Community Expectations

We encourage all users and contributors to review our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for expectations around respectful and responsible behavior when using or discussing AI tools in this project.

## Disclaimer
