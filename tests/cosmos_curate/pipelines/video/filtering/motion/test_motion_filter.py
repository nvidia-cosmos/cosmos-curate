"""Functional test for motion vector decoding and motion filtering stages.

This test verifies the motion vector decoding and filtering stages using a sample video.
The expected motion score values were obtained by running the motion filter pipeline
on the sample video (ForBiggerBlazes.mp4) and capturing the actual values produced.
These values serve as a regression test to ensure the motion detection algorithm
maintains consistency across code changes.
