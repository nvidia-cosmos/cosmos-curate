"""Action-modality CPU tests: the key-free descriptor extract / project contract.

Both phases are pure compute over positions: they read no identity column and
are cardinality- and order-preserving, so the fill worker can attach ``clip_id``
positionally. A clip that is missing / unreadable / undecodable / geometrically
rejected keeps its own row with a NULL descriptor (which projects to an all-NULL,
pending action group) rather than being dropped.

The action leg is Mecka-only: applicability is purely a non-empty
``action_data_uri`` (no ``source_dataset``, no dexterous registry), and every
artifact is read as a self-describing ACT2 ``.bin`` and aligned as mecka. A
non-mecka payload lacks the hand arrays and rejects geometrically to a NULL
descriptor rather than crashing the leg. The tests assert that no-drop contract,
the per-batch single-read memo, the fail-closed read/decode path, the
round-trip alignment of ``decode_descriptors``, and that the per-batch rejection
summary names a bounded, redacted sample of the rejected artifacts - never PCA
numerics, which are the fit's concern.
