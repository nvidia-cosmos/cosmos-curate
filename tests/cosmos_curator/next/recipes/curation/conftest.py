"""A synthetic wide ``clips.lance`` builder, shared by every Curate test.

Curate reads and writes ONE table, so almost every question about it is a
question about the shape of that table: how many fragments it has, which
embedding groups exist, which rows carry a vector, whether ``clip_id`` is really
unique, and which vectors are pathological. ``ClipsTableSpec`` makes each of
those an argument, so a test states the shape it needs in one line and asserts
against a table it fully owns.

::

    ClipsTableSpec(fragments=3, action=GroupState.NULL, ...)
        |
        v
    per fragment: base columns generated from CLIP_SCHEMA
        |         + the enabled embedding groups' columns
        v
    write_clips_table   one lance write per fragment, so the fragment
        |               count and the row-to-fragment mapping are exact
        v
    ClipsTable(uri, clip_ids per fragment)

The base columns are GENERATED from the producer's own ``CLIP_SCHEMA`` rather
than hand-listed, so the fixture stays faithful when that schema gains a field
and fails loudly - on an unhandled Arrow type - rather than silently drifting
narrow. Only the identity and label columns (``clip_id``, ``task_name``,
``subtask_name``) get meaningful values; the rest are filled from their type,
because no Curate behaviour reads them and asserting on generated values would
couple a test to this file instead of to a mechanism. ``subtask_name`` is
meaningful even though Curate no longer reads it, because the producer writes it
and a fixture that dropped it would stop being a faithful source table.

Four generated properties are deliberate and load-bearing, because getting any of
them wrong makes a whole class of test unable to fail:

- Every vector is drawn from a generator seeded on its own ``(row, column name)``
  pair, so two runs of one spec give byte-identical tables while no two vectors
  in the table are equal. Seeding on the row alone would give every modality of a
  row the same direction, and swapping or reweighting two equal blocks is a
  no-op; seeding on a column's POSITION would do the same, since all three groups
  number their vector field 0. The only intended source of an identical pair is
  ``duplicate_vectors``.
- The ``(task_name, subtask_name)`` pairs come from an explicit cycle that makes
  the three fairness groups uneven, in a 1:2:3 ratio. Two independent moduli look
  varied and are exactly uniform, and a uniform population never asks a group for
  more than it holds, so the water-fill's redistribution branch is unreachable.
- Those pairs are RAW annotation spellings, not canonical keys: several wordings
  of one instruction differ in case, interior whitespace, Unicode composition or a
  trailing mark. A fixture already in canonical form makes the pipeline's fold an
  identity, so every downstream assertion would hold with the fold deleted.
  ``CANONICAL_TASKS`` names the task keys they collapse to.
- The subtask text vectors lie in ``SUBTASK_REGIONS`` tight bundles that CROSS the
  subtask label partition (see ``subtask_region``). The level-2 fairness key is a
  k-means cell over that block, so the shape of the block is the only thing that
  can make the key observable. Both natural shapes hide it: per-row directions in
  a high-dimensional space put every row in its own cell, and one shared direction
  puts every row in one cell. Either way substituting the cell for the label
  changes nothing downstream, no single assertion is at fault, and a level-2 key
  computed from anything at all still passes.

``ClipsTableSpec`` refuses any knob it could not honour - an index past the end of
the table, a pair naming one row twice, a duplicate pair or an unusable vector
placed where the vectors would read NULL - because a fixture that quietly drops a
configured property leaves the test that asked for it passing on nothing.

``run_child`` is here for the same reason the table builder is: several modules
assert their own import purity, and the only honest way to check it is in an
interpreter this session has not already imported them into. ``POISONED_IMPORTS``,
``poisoning`` and ``assert_poisoning_fired`` are the harness those tests run
under; the latter two are plain functions rather than fixtures because neither
holds per-test state, one being a string builder and the other an assertion.
