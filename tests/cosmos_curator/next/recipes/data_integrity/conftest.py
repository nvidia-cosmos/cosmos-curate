"""Shared fixtures for the data-integrity store tests.

These build results by running the *real* engine over a synthetic timeline rather
than hand-assembling measurements. Half of what the store tests assert is that a
value survives the trip from the kernel through Arrow and back, so a faked
measurement would fake the thing under test.

Exposed as fixtures because the test tree is not a package (pytest runs with
``--import-mode=importlib``), so one test module cannot import another's helpers.
