"""Tests for the ``embeddings`` pipeline-kind surface: the CLI contract and its dispatch.

Three layers, all runnable in the default CPU job:

- Surface tests against the eight callbacks (template, validate, render, schema),
  which need no table and no Ray.
- Dispatch tests that stub ``run_embedding_pipeline``, pinning the payload and
  message the adapter assembles and proving the config is resolved exactly once.
- Two wiring smokes against a real local ``clips.lance``: one without Ray (the
  schema-widening commit and the skip path) and one ``ray_local`` fill through a
  stub embedder, which is the only place a config file drives real vectors into
  the table.
