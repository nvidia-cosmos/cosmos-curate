"""Driver and action-basis tests for the direct-``clips.lance`` embedding pipeline.

Two layers, both runnable in the default CPU job:

- Pure driver-logic tests (no Ray): the fixed modality cascade, the action-only
  weight-staging no-op, the missing-table failure, the schema-widening commit, the
  no-work short circuit, the basis-staleness refusal, the total-outage guard, and
  the PCA sampling helpers. None of them starts a worker.
- One actor-pool dispatch test (``ray_local``): it starts a real actor but embeds
  nothing. It exists because the sampling-helper tests feed hand-built batches and
  therefore cannot catch a mis-scheduled extractor. It drops the pixi
  ``py_executable`` so the actor runs in the interpreter running the test rather
  than the container's environment.

Filling real vectors end to end needs the container's pixi environment, so that is
covered by the GPU job rather than here. The action leg is Mecka-only:
applicability is a non-empty ``action_data_uri``, and each artifact is a
self-describing ACT2 ``.bin`` decoded with no dataset registry, so a monkeypatched
dataset name resolves identically in the driver (which writes the bins) and in Ray
workers (which only decode them). The ``source_dataset`` column is retained in the
base schema but no longer read by the leg.
