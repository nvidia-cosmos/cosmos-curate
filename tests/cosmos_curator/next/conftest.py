def ray_local() -> Iterator[None]:
    """Start one local Ray cluster for the whole session.

    This is the only place in the Curator Next test tree that starts a cluster,
    and it must stay that way. Session scope means pytest caches the fixture
    after the first test that requests it and never re-runs this body, so a
    module that shuts the cluster down to run one of its own leaves every later
    consumer holding a fixture that no longer matches a live cluster. Nothing
    reports that: Ray Data auto-initialises a whole-machine cluster when none
    exists rather than failing, so the later tests keep passing while silently
    losing the CPU ceiling below. A module needing a shape this one does not
    provide is a design question, not a local fix.

    Session scope is also what the suite's wall clock wants, since cluster
    startup dominates it and each test builds its own datasets under its own
    ``tmp_path``, so nothing leaks between tests through the cluster.

    ``num_gpus=0`` is deliberate: it keeps the cluster shape fixed for the whole
    run, so a test needing GPU resources must patch ``ray.cluster_resources``
    rather than re-initialise.

    The two-CPU budget is a hard ceiling on any single task's request. Ray Data
    does not reject a task that asks for more than the cluster holds - it
    backpressures it under ``ResourceBudget`` forever, with no error and no
    progress - so a test driving a Ray Data stage must pin the resource knobs it
    passes rather than inherit a production default sized for a real cluster.

    ``curator_io`` is advertised because production IO stages request slots of it,
    and a cluster without it does not report the gap usefully: the guarded entry
    points raise a bare resource error while the unguarded ones hand Ray Data a
    task that can never be scheduled. Sixteen is an IO-slot count, not compute -
    it leaves the two-CPU ceiling above exactly as it is.
