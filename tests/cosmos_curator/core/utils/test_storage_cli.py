"""Characterization tests for the storage CLI helpers, carried over from their predecessor.

Written against the private cloud-source helper module that used to sit in
``cosmos_curator/core/sensors/scripts/``, while it was still unmodified, to pin what it
did before :mod:`cosmos_curator.core.utils.storage` replaced it. That module is now
deleted and these tests have moved here with it, rewired onto
:mod:`cosmos_curator.core.utils.storage_cli` -- so they no longer describe a retirement
plan, they are the suite for the helpers that replaced it.

The predecessor had a second heir, the recipe policy layer
:mod:`cosmos_curator.next.recipes.data_integrity.storage_io`; the tests pinning that
half sit in the recipe's own test directory, as
``tests/cosmos_curator/next/recipes/data_integrity/test_storage_io.py``. The fakes both
suites drive are shared from :mod:`tests.cosmos_curator.core.utils.storage_fakes`, so
neither file carries a fake SDK the other one needs.

**How this file is organised, and why.** Everything above the ``BEHAVIOUR`` banner is
mechanism: how a subject is constructed, which SDK entry point is faked, which
environment variables are scrubbed. Everything below it is behaviour: values, exception
types, message substrings, call counts and ordering. The move rewrote the mechanism
block and left the behaviour block standing, which is what shows the replacement
preserves behaviour rather than merely compiling.

Four assertions did change, and each says so in its docstring under ``DIVERGENCE``,
naming what the storage layer does instead:

* an uppercase suffix in the filter matched nothing before, and matches now
* an empty suffix tuple matched nothing before, and is rejected now
* a missing Azure profile arrived without the credentials hint before, and carries it now
* the URI predicates raised on ``None`` before, and return ``False`` now

There is no cloud-mocking library in any pixi environment (no ``moto``, no
``botocore.stub``), so the fakes are hand-rolled and the credential tests drive real
``boto3`` against a throwaway shared-credentials file. Nothing here performs network I/O.

# MECHANISM -- subject construction and hand-rolled backend fakes.
# The move to the storage layer rewrote this block. Nothing here asserts anything.
#
# Two shapes recur, and both exist so the behaviour block below could stay put:
#
# * The storage layer takes a ``StorageClient``, not a backend SDK client, so the SDK
#   fakes are wrapped by ``storage_fakes.s3_client`` / ``storage_fakes.azure_client``.
#   The fakes themselves are still SDK-shaped, because the request each Curator call
#   makes on the wire is exactly what these tests exist to pin.
# * The subject sometimes returns a wrapper where it used to return the SDK client
#   (``make_s3_client``) or a section mapping (the Azure profile lookup). The adapters
#   named ``_make_*`` / ``_load_*`` unwrap that, so an assertion still reads the value
#   an operator would care about.
