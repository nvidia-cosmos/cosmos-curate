"""Guard against subprocesses that silently inherit a controlling terminal.

Ray (>=2.57) puts each worker in its own process group. If the process tree has a
controlling terminal, those groups are *background* groups relative to it, and the kernel
stops any background process that reads stdin by sending it SIGTTIN. A stopped ffmpeg never
returns, so the owning stage sits at 0% CPU with zero completions and no error -- the
failure mode this guard exists to prevent.

Removing the pseudo-TTY from the local launcher is the root fix (see
``test_launch_local.test_launch_command``), but library code also runs under launchers that
do allocate a terminal, such as the interactive ``ssh -t`` and ``srun --pty`` paths in
``slurm_shell``. So every spawn in library code must decide stdin explicitly rather than
inherit it.

This is a structural guard, not a behavioral test: regex sweeps of this codebase have twice
missed a spawn helper (``check_call``), and a new unguarded call site arrived from ``main``
days after the original fix. Parsing the AST catches call sites that string matching does
not.
